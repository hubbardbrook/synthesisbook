    "text": "Introduction\nThe Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study (HBES) has advanced scientific understanding of the structure, composition and function of northern hardwood forests and linked aquatic ecosystems.\nThis online book is designed as a concise but comprehensive synthesis of the HBES. Many readers will be interested to see the award-winning book by Richard Holmes and Gene Likens entitled, Hubbard Brook: The Story Of A Forest Ecosystem, a synthesis of the HBES for a general audience. Advanced readers are directed to the book, Biogeochemistry of a Forested Ecosystem (2013) by Gene Likens as well as the series of detailed element monographs published in the journal Biogeochemistry (Likens et al. 1994 (K), 1998 (Ca), 2002 (S); Fahey et al. 2005 (C); and Lovett et al. 2005 (Cl)). The synthesis is presented at the level of a graduate or advanced undergraduate student audience. The primary objective of the book is to introduce students and other prospective researchers to the current state of knowledge about the Hubbard Brook ecosystem. The chapters have been developed by scientific experts on each of the topics studied in the HBES, and they will be updated and expanded as new knowledge and data are generated by the HBES – it is meant to be a living volume. Links to the broader literature and to HBES data sets are provided to facilitate more detailed explorations. Teaching and learning exercises that utilize data from the HBES will be added as they are developed by our experts for academic use.",

    "text": "1.1 Site Description\nChapter Editor(s): Timothy Fahey\nFor over 60 years scientists have been studying the dynamics of forests and linked aquatic ecosystems in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study (HBES) is an ongoing effort to understand the ecology, hydrology, energetics and biogeochemistry of this temperate forest ecosystem. The synthesis that follows provides an overview of several components of the HBES interpreted in light of current understanding at the level of the advanced student. The objective is to provide interested researchers with a succinct summary that will be helpful for guiding research and education efforts.\nThe Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) is located in the southern part of the White Mountain National Forest (WMNF) in central New Hampshire (Figure 1.1). The HBEF is characteristic of much of the White Mountain National Forest (Fahey et al. 2015) The National Forest has hilly, occasionally steep topography; coarse, acidic, glacially-derived soils; bedrock dominated by metamorphic rock of igneous and sedimentary origin; northern hardwood forests on lower slopes and spruce-fir forests at higher elevations (above ca. 800 m).",

    "text": "1.2 Climate\nThe continental climate at the HBEF features long, cold winters and mild to cool summers (see Climate chapter). Major air flow over the forest is either (1) continental polar air from subarctic North America (the predominant direction), (2) maritime tropical air from the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico from the south or southwest, or (3) maritime air from the North Atlantic out of the east or northeast. In spite of the proximity of Hubbard Brook to the ocean (116 km), the climate is predominantly continental.\nAnnual precipitation averages about 1,400 mm, of which about one third to one quarter is snow. A snowpack usually persists from mid-December until mid-April, with a peak depth in March of about 1,000 mm, having about 250 to 300 mm of water content.\nWinters are long and cold. January averages about -9oC, and long periods of low temperatures from -12˚C to -18˚C are common. Even though temperatures are low most of the time, occasional midwinter thaws result in elevated streamflow. Short, cool summers are the rule. The average July temperature is 18oC.\nThe average number of days without killing frost is 145; however, the growing season for trees is considered to be from 15 May, the approximate time of full leaf development, to 15 September, when the leaves begin to fall.\nThe estimated annual evapotranspiration (ET) is about 500 mm, determined by difference between precipitation and streamflow. This calculation is a reasonable approach for Hubbard Brook because of the apparent minimal deep seepage and annual removal of summer soil-water deficits by autumnal rains and spring snowmelt.",

    "text": "1.3 Geology\nThe eastern portion of the Experimental Forest (watersheds 1-6, and 9 included; Figure 1) is underlain by a complex assemblage of metasedimentary and igneous rocks. The major map unit is the Silurian Rangeley Formation, consisting of quartz mica schist and quartzite interbedded with sulfidic schist and calc-silicate granulite. Originally deposited as mudstones, sandstones and conglomerates, these rocks have been metamorphosed to sillimanite grade and have undergone four stages of deformation. Deformation style evident in outcrops is primarily tight isoclinal folds. However joints, slickensides and mylonites indicate brittle deformation as well. The metamorphic rocks were later intruded by a variety of igneous rocks including the Devonian Concord Granite, pegmatites, and Mesozoic diabase and lamprophyre dikes. The western portion of the forest (portions of watersheds 7 and 8 included) is underlain by the Devonian Kinsman Granodiorite, a foliated granitic rock with megacrysts of potassium feldspar.\nContinental glaciers, which blanketed the region during the Pleistocene and retreated some 13,000 years ago, removed most preexisting soils. Glacial movement was primarily in a southeasterly direction as indicated by striations on bedrock surfaces, and by fragments of rocks in the till which are typical of bedrock to the northwest of the Hubbard Brook Valley. Materials deposited by the glacier are highly variable in degree of sorting and grain size, ranging from clays to 10m diameter boulders. The depth of glacial deposits ranges from zero on ridgetops and in stream valleys (resulting in bedrock outcrops) to 50m in the vicinity of Mirror Lake. Poorly sorted glacial till, commonly 2m thick, covers the bedrock in most of the valley. Ice contact terraces in the lower valley, consisting of well sorted sands and gravels, are typically tens of meters thick.",

    "text": "1.4 Soils\nIn the HBEF soils are predominantly well-drained Spodosols, more specifically, Typic Haplorthods derived from glacial till, with sandy loam textures. There are no residual soils, (i.e., derived from weathered bedrock). Principal soil series are the sandy loams of the Berkshire series, along with the Skerry, Becket, and Lyman series. These soils are acidic (pH about 4.5 or less) and relatively infertile (Table 1). A 20- to 200-mm thick forest floor layer is usually present. Soils on the ridgetops may consist of a thin accumulation of organic matter, resting directly on bedrock. Table 1. Summary soils data for Watershed 5 at the HBEF (after Johnson et al. 1991a,b). Soil Types: Typic Haplorthod Typic Dystrochrept Soil Series: Berkshire, Skerry, Becket, Lyman, Tunbridge Avg.

Depth to the C horizon averages about 0.6 m. At various places in the Forest, the C horizon exists as an impermeable pan. These layers restrict root development and water movement. Rocks of all sizes are scattered throughout the soil profile. In many locations boulder fields are prominent features.\nA prominent feature of the surface topography throughout the HBEF is the rough pit-and-mound appearance caused by the uprooting of trees. Uprooting mixes mineral soil from lower mineral horizons with nutrient-rich organic surface layers or it can deposit the lower mineral layers directly on top of the forest floor humus layers without mixing, creating buried horizons. This natural disturbance changes seedbed conditions for regenerating species, and affects weathering and biogeochemical cycles.",

    "text": "1.5 Streams\nAlthough stream channels occupy only 1% of the land area, the streams play an important role in many processes throughout the HBEF. The numerous streams in the HBEF range from small ephemeral channels that often dry up during summer to a large perennial 5th-order stream (Hubbard Brook). Because of the shallow soil depths and high soil porosity, the stream channels quickly swell during large storms (e.g., 80 mm or more). As much as 60 to 80% of storm precipitation can pass through the stream as storm flow.\nStreamwater is usually characterized by low concentrations of suspended materials due to the coarse-grained texture of the soil. Mineral and organic particulate material is suspended and carried in storm periods, but once the flow recedes these materials quickly settle, leaving the stream with low concentrations of suspended solids. About 28 kg/ha of particulate matter (both inorganic and organic) are transported out of the watershed by streams each year.\nMost of the stream channels have exposed bedrock at some locations. However, the first to third order streams have channels primarily made up of mineral and organic particulate matter lodged behind organic debris dams. These dams form a stair-step pattern in stream channels, and they play important roles in regulating many physical, chemical, and biological processes in the streams.",

    "section": "1.6 Historical Perspective",
    "text": "1.6 Historical Perspective\nThe Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest was established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service in 1955 as a major center for hydrologic research in New England. The initial size delineated for research was a 3,037-ha, bowl-shaped Valley (Figure 1).\nDuring the first eight years following the establishment of the HBEF, the Northeastern Research Station of the USDA Forest Service developed a network of precipitation and stream-gauging stations, and installed weather instrumentation, as well as soil and vegetation monitoring sites on small experimental watersheds. Data from these installations combined with several initial studies formed the hydrometeorologic foundation for much of the future research at the HBEF. The major emphasis in these early studies was to determine the impact of forest land management on water yield,water quality, and flood flow.\nThe Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study originated in 1960 with the idea of using a small watershed approach to study element flux and cycling. The initial development of the HBES was slow and deliberate. The entire effort during the first two years, 1963-1965, was conducted by three scientists and one technician at Dartmouth College and three scientists and one technician from the USDA Forest Service (USDA-FS). At that time, there were no precedents to follow since comprehensive studies of ecosystems had not been initiated. Using the small watershed approach, studies of element-hydrologic interactions were conducted to form a basis for subsequent process-level and experimental research. In this regard, the investigators were fortunate to rather quickly develop quantitative element budgets for replicated ecosystems. These results provided insight into the function of natural ecosystems and helped focus future lines of research. It was agreed that slow growth would be more manageable and would allow for interaction among all senior investigators, ensuring proper coordination and development of the overall study. Research problems that were timely and particularly pertinent to the overall research goals of the study were identified. From the beginning, the HBES has emphasized the value of knowledge derived from cooperative research. At the same time, individual research freedom has always been encouraged among both cooperating scientists and graduate students. This policy has been largely responsible for the intellectual growth of the HBES, as well as its role as a center for undergraduate and graduate education in ecosystem science.\nHBES has developed into a relatively complex matrix of projects involving a large number of scientists from diverse disciplines. Beginning in 1987, core funding for the HBES has been provided through the Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) network of the National Science Foundation. Together with support from the USDA Forest Service, the LTER program provides base funding for most monitoring activities in the HBES. Individuals or groups of researchers are supported by competitive grants to pursue a variety of specific research studies in the HBES in cooperation with the LTER program. From 1963, over 1750 publications have been produced through the HBES, providing a wealth of information on the structure, function and development of forest, stream and lake ecosystems.\nFor more history of Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest: Events Leading to the Establishment of the HBEF, written by Jim Hornbeck, May 2001 (pdf)",

    "section": "1.7 Conceptual Background",
    "text": "1.7 Conceptual Background\nThe mission of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study is to improve understanding of the response of northern forest ecosystems to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. In the overall conceptual model underlying the Study (Figure 2), three types of disturbances - changing atmospheric chemistry, climate, and biota - drive changes in the interacting components of the ecosystem, including vegetation, biogeochemistry, hydrology, and food webs. These changes play out on a template that includes the biogeophysical characteristics of the landscape. The ecosystem responses may feedback to modify the template and alter biotic change. The template and the functional responses change through time in response to the disturbances and internal drivers.\nFigure 2. Conceptual model underlying the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study\nIn Figure 3 we illustrate measured and hypothesized changes in ecosystem concentrations and fluxes in response to long-term decreases in S and N atmospheric deposition and increases in CO2 concentrations. Up and down arrows indicate increases and decreases. Gold arrows reflect measured changes, purple arrows show hypothesized changes. Gray arrows indicate major ecosystem processes driving other responses in the ecosystem. We have observed increases in soil pH and base saturation in response to declining S and N deposition and expect these changes to increase soil P availability. We have also observed increases in soil microbial biomass, decreases in forest floor organic matter stocks, and shifts in solution N losses from inorganic to organic forms. We hypothesize that rising atmospheric CO2 contributes to these changes by stimulating plant CO2 uptake and nutrient demand for growth, which in turn drives an increase in plant N and P uptake from solution, increased nutrient resorption from litter and decreased litter C/N ratios, as well as increases in allocation of plant C belowground to spur organic matter mineralization and soil respiration.\nFigure 3. Illustration of measured and hypothesized changes in ecosystem concentrations and fluxes in response to long-term decreases in S and N atmospheric deposition and increases in CO2 concentrations.\nClimate change disturbance has myriad effects on forest ecosystem dynamics. Here we highlight (Figure 4) a conceptual framework for diagnosing the cause of the recent observed increase in rates of evapotranspiration (ET) at Hubbard Brook (see Hydrology Chapter). We are investigating how atmospheric conditions and vegetation interact nonlinearly to affect ET. Orange arrows indicate observed trends in the long-term data. Question marks show where there is uncertainty in our understanding. The green arrow shows how the coupling of canopy and aerodynamic resistance affects rates of evapotranspiration.\nFigure 4. A conceptual framework for diagnosing the cause of the recent observed increase in rates of evapotranspiration (ET) at Hubbard Brook.\nOur conceptual model of the hierarchical response of ecosystem function to chronic stressors and episodic events is illustrated in Figure 5). (A) Initial responses to stress trigger species-specific responses with limited system-wide impact. (B) With continued exposure, species abundances begin to re-order, resulting in reduced ecosystem function. (C) This slow loss of function can be accelerated by an (D) episodic disturbance. (E) If the stress persists, further changes in the biota are expected. These disturbance-driven shifts in biodiversity will have profound consequences on species additions and losses, species demography and evolution, and energy flow (inset).\nFigure 5. The conceptual model of the hierarchical response of ecosystem function to chronic stressors and episodic events\nOur conceptual model of the biogeophysical template on an idealized hillslope (Figure 6) shows five slope positions along a depth-to-bedrock gradient that results in predictable variation in soils, shallow groundwater movement, and saturation frequency. Hydro-bio-pedo interactions along these soil-slope variations structure vegetation and other biota, form linkages with temporary and perennial streams, and shape the complex functional responses of ecosystem components (Figure 2).\nFigure 6.

    "text": "1.8 Research Approaches\nThe framework for the HBES is the small watershed approach which provides precise quantitative water and element input-output budgets for the forested ecosystems. In a catchment where the underlying bedrock is impermeable, water falling on the catchment leaves only by evapotranspiration (ET) or as stream discharge. By quantifying the latter, annual ET can be calculated by difference:\nEq. 1. AET = Precipitation – stream discharge\nFor chemical elements without a gas phase at Earth temperature, the small watershed also allows estimation of soil weathering (Johnson et al. 1981):\nEq. 2. Weathering = stream output – atmospheric input + ∆ storage\nHere, the stream output and atmospheric input of an element are determined as the product of water flux and the element concentration in the water. The ∆ storage term refers to any change in the stock or pool of an element in the soil organic matter or vegetation biomass in the ecosystem. For example, when vegetation biomass is aggrading some of the chemicals weathered from soil minerals are accumulating in the trees rather than lost in stream discharge and the ∆ storage term is positive in Equation 2. Also, some elements enter the ecosystems as dry rather than wet deposition (e.g. dust particles), and this flux is included in the atmospheric input term.\nFor elements with gaseous phases (e.g., N, C), separate measurements of gas fluxes in and out of the ecosystem are needed to estimate material budgets (see below). Experimental manipulations (e.g., forest harvest, fertilization) can be applied at the small watershed scale to quantify whole ecosystem responses (Bormann et al. 1974). The internal processes determining the whole ecosystem responses are measured at the plot scale at selected locations within or nearby the small watershed. Together these measurements form the basis for much of the research in the HBES including long-term monitoring as detailed below. Atmospheric Inputs\nFigure 7. Atmospheric deposition collectors at Hubbard Brook.\nAtmospheric deposition of elements to the ecosystem is the sum of wet and dry deposition. Measurement of wet deposition has been conducted on a weekly basis since 1963 at a network of sampling sites across the HBEF (Figure 7). All major dissolved solutes are measured and together with precipitation water volume from standard rain gauges, element fluxes in wet deposition are determined.\nDry deposition of particles and gases is more difficult to quantify than wet deposition and can constitute a substantial proportion of the input of several important elements, especially nitrogen and sulfur, that are derived partly from pollutant emissions. Some of the dry deposition can be captured on artificial samplers or as canopy throughfall, but the calculation of dry deposition flux is complex and uncertain, and we refer the reader to detailed explanations in the literature (Likens et al. 2002). Stream Output\nFigure 8. Photograph of a V-notch weir at Hubbard Brook.\nStream discharge of water from nine small watersheds in the HBEF is measured continuously with 90o or 120o V-notch weirs located at the base of the surveyed catchments (Figure 8.). The weirs continuously measure stage height in a stilling pond above the weir outlet. Each weir is calibrated by directly measuring the relationship between stage height and water flux. To calculate element fluxes, water samples for chemical analysis are collected weekly just above each weir. More frequent measurements to more precisely quantify storm-event fluxes have been conducted periodically using automated samplers. Flux of particulate matter is measured by removing accumulated material in the weir stilling pond periodically. The flux of fine suspended solids during large storm events also has been measured using permeable bags positioned below the weir.",

The basic approach is to measure the diameter of trees across the whole watershed (e.g., WS6, WS1) or in smaller plots usually at five-year intervals. Forest biomass is estimated using allometric equations relating DBH to other tree dimensions (e.g. total biomass and biomass of tissue components like leaves, branches, etc.). These equations were developed at the site by directly measuring trees harvested during experimental manipulations (Whittaker et al. 1974, Siccama et al. 1994). The pool or stock of an element is estimated from the product of mass and element concentration in various tissues. Thus, changes in the stock of an element in the forest biomass are calculated typically at a 5-year intervals.",

The soil is carefully excavated manually from a 0.5 m2 area through depth increments to the C horizon. Soil mass in each depth increment is weighed and sieved in the field and subsamples are taken for chemical analysis in the laboratory. Because of the large stocks and high spatial variability of elements in soil, detection of changes through time or in response to treatments is challenging. Nevertheless, we have been able to estimate the net soil release for major elements resulting from acid deposition and forest harvest on the basis of quantitative pit sampling (Johnson et al. 1991).",

Gaseous flux of N remains a key uncertainty in the N budget at the HBEF (Yanai et al. 2013). The principal gaseous flux of N results from denitrification, a process that is notoriously variable in space and time. The flux chamber approach, in which the accumulation of gaseous N diffusing from soil is measured over short time intervals (e.g. minutes), is applied routinely to estimate flux of nitrous oxide in several plots in and around the experimental watersheds at the HBEF. Unfortunately, because of the high background in the atmosphere this approach is not effective for measuring N2 flux. Laboratory, isotopic and modeling approaches have provided indirect estimates of N2 flux from soils (e.g., Wexler et al. 2014).\nFigure 9. Photograph of flux tower instrumentation at Hubbard Brook.\nFluxes of carbon dioxide and water vapor from the forest ecosystem can be estimated using aerodynamic approaches with eddy flux towers. Recently, an eddy flux tower has been installed in the lower valley at the HBEF and began collecting data in 2016 (Figure 9). The facility will soon provide the first direct estimates of gross primary production, autotrophic and total ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem productivity for the forest in the footprint of the tower.",

In particular, element leaching through soils is measured using zero-tension lysimeters positioned beneath the forest floor, Bh and Bs horizons. Water fluxes at each depth, estimated with a hydrologic model, are used with measured element concentrations in soil solutions to estimate soil leaching fluxes (Cho et al. 2010).\nLitterfall is measured using permanent litter traps co-located in plots with soil lysimeters. Litter is sorted by species, providing annual estimates of leaf biomass and leaf area index in these plots. Periodically, the chemistry of leaf litter is measured; combined with chemistry of live foliage from the plots, these measurements provide estimates of nutrient resorption from senescing foliage, a large internal ecosystem flux especially for N and P (Ryan and Bormann 1982). Deposition of woody litter as coarse woody debris is measured annually on cleared 2.5 m2 plots co-located with litter traps. The chemistry of canopy throughfall and element fluxes in canopy leaching also have been measured in these intensive plots (Lovett et al. 1996) as well as the biomass, chemistry and turnover of fine and coarse roots, using coring and rhizotron methods, so that a comprehensive accounting of the principal internal element fluxes is available for the forest ecosystems in the experimental watersheds.",

Pollen accumulation rates for pollen types in Mirror Lake (Davis 1985).\nAs originally conceived by Bormann and Likens (1979), the Hubbard Brook landscape is dominated by northern hardwood forest which consists of a patchwork of stands of varying structure and composition that shifts through time, the “shifting-mosaic steady state.” The forest is dominated by three broadleaf deciduous tree species, sugar maple, yellow birch and American beech, with a mixture of several deciduous and evergreen conifer species. Above about 800 meters in the HB valley, subalpine forest of red spruce and balsam fir (and formerly mountain paper birch) is dominant, especially on thinner, less fertile soils.\nThe composition of the forest at Hubbard Brook has seen periods of relative stability interspersed with shifts owing to a variety of forces. These include climatic changes, natural disturbances such as pests and pathogens, and most recently human activity, especially logging in the 19th and 20th century. The Holocene forest vegetation history of the Hubbard Brook area has been reconstructed on the basis of sediment coring of Mirror Lake, located near the valley outlet (Figure 1; Davis 1985).\nThe area was deglaciated between 13-14,000 yr BP, and the climate soon warmed to resemble the modern climate. Spruce was the first tree species to invade post-glacial tundra around Mirror Lake and pollen data suggest that it spread widely through the HB valley by 11,000 yr BP. Fir, birch and Populus increased about 1,000 years later and spruce abundance subsequently declined. Thereafter, pine and oak became more abundant suggestive of a warmer climate 9-8,000 yr BP. By 7,000 yr BP, abundance of fir, pine and oak declined, while maple, beech and hemlock increased. Hemlock exhibited a sudden decline at about 5,000 yr BP that has been ascribed to an insect or pathogen, (but see Foster et al. 2006), and it then gradually recovered over a 1,000 year period. With that notable exception, and a resurgence in spruce abundance beginning about 2,000 yr BP, the forest composition in the HB valley was fairly stable after 6,000 yr BP until the arrival of Europeans in the 19th century. At the time of European settlement, the composition of the northern hardwood forest in the HB valley was comparable to the modern forest, being dominated by yellow birch, sugar maple and American beech; however, based on historical records (Chittenden 1905) red spruce was more abundant and sugar maple less so in the pre-settlement forests of the White Mountains. Spruce was selectively logged from the HB valley in the late 19th century, reducing its abundance thereafter. Much of the HB valley was subsequently heavily logged during the first two decades of the 20thcentury and most of the modern forest stands date from this time period. An exceptional hurricane disturbance in 1938 blew down extensive areas of the south and east facing slopes and salvage logging following this event further opened the residual forest. Notably, the 1938 hurricane caused much less damage to younger stands that arose following early 20th century logging than older lightly cut areas of the forest (Peart et al. 1992). In summary, the modern forest in the HB valley exhibits a complex age and size structure that varies spatially as a result of these historical large-scale disturbance events. However, despite this anthropogenic disturbance history the current structure and composition of the HB forest is similar to that of a virgin remnant forest at the Bowl Research National Area located about 30 km east of HB (Figure 2, 3; Schwarz et al. 2001, Martin and Bailey 1999).\nFigure 2. Size-class distribution of tree stems in old-growth (Bowl) and second-growth northern hardwood forests (Schwarz et al. 2001).\nFigure 2.

Basal area and density of tree species in virgin (Bowl) and secondary forests (HBEF, W6) in the mid-1990s (Schwarz et al. 2001).\nModern Forest\nA detailed picture of the current structure and composition of the second-growth forest at HB is provided on the basis of a valley-wide grid of 431 permanent plots. Overall, the size structure of the forest exhibits the usual “reverse-j” shaped curve typical of mature forests composed mostly of shade-tolerant species (Figure 2). Notably, sugar maple and beech are considerably more abundant and yellow birch and conifers less abundant in south-facing reference WS6 than for the entire HB valley.\nFive principal forest vegetation types are distinguished within the HBEF (Figure 4) including the core northern hardwood forest; a hemlock-hardwood type, restricted to the lower valley and; a high-elevation hardwood type, marked by the increased dominance of yellow birch relative to beech, the relative scarcity of sugar maple, and the inclusion of red spruce as a common species.\nFigure 4. Forest vegetation types in the Hubbard Brook Valley (Battles, unpublished data).\nFigure 4. Forest vegetation types in the Hubbard Brook Valley (Battles, unpublished data).\nFigure 5. Demographic factors of dominant tree species in the Hubbard Brook Valley at the turn of the 21st century (van Doorn et al., 2011).\nFigure 5. Demographic factors of dominant tree species in the Hubbard Brook Valley at the turn of the 21st century (van Doorn et al., 2011).\nAt higher elevations, conifer dominated forests prevail with two distinct types: a spruce-fir-birch type and a fir-birch type ( paper birch died out of the latter types during the early 21st century – see below). Early-successional forest stands are found on four small watersheds (WS2, 4, 5, 101) that were harvested experimentally between 1966 and 1984. On a valley-wide basis (van Doorn et al. 2011), three tree species have exhibited declining biomass in recent years (yellow birch, American beech and paper birch) while five species have been increasing (sugar maple, red spruce, balsam fir, hemlock and white ash). The decline of American beech is a consequence of an introduced disease complex (Houston 1975); similar changes are anticipated in the near future for hemlock and white ash (see below).Trends in forest structure and composition are indicated by the key population parameters of mortality, growth and reproduction. Live tree biomass of the HB forest has been nearly constant in recent years, as losses in biomass owing to tree mortality (28.5 Mg/ha) have been balanced by gains from growth of surviving trees (24.2 Mg/ha) and recruitment into the &gt; 10 cm dbh class (2.8 Mg/ha). Losses from mortality on both a biomass and stem density basis have been greatest for yellow birch, the most abundant species in the HB valley. This trend probably reflects the age-structure of the yellow birch population that consists of veteran trees that pre-date 19th century logging and many individuals that regenerated after early 20th century logging and the 1938 hurricane. On a stem density basis balsam fir also exhibited high mortality, but these losses have been more than counterbalanced by high recruitment (Figure 5); fir also showed the highest relative growth rate of all tree species at HB.\nConversely, paper birch exhibited high mortality, low recruitment and the lowest growth rate of all tree species at the HBEF. This pattern signals a species in decline, reflecting in part senescence of a cohort originating from the large-scale disturbance in the early 20th century as well as possible stresses owing to ice storm damage and severe drought in recent years. The picture for paper birch is complicated by the fact that two species (B. papyrifera and B. cordifolia) comprise the surveyed population, and future work comparing their dynamics is needed.\nThe population of sugar maple, the second most abundant species at HB, appears to be near equilibrium on a valley-wide basis, with recruitment matching mortality on a density basis and growth exceeding mortality on a live biomass basis (Figure 6). However, as discussed below, in some areas of the HB forest, especially in and around the experimental watersheds on the south facing slope (Figure 4) sugar maple is clearly declining with high mortality and low reproduction. Moreover, at the stage of development of the HB forest, we would expect the relative abundance of sugar maple to be increasing on a valley-wide basis. Hence, sugar maple seems to be suffering from unexpected decline at HB.American beech is also declining throughout the HB valley, largely as a result of beech bark disease and losses from mortality greatly exceed growth. However, on a stem density basis, recruitment exceeds mortality, partly reflecting prolific vegetative sprouting from roots (Siccama et al. 2007). Like sugar maple, red spruce is a population near steady state in the HB valley on both a biomass and stem density basis, despite clear evidence of its regional decline and susceptibility to damage resulting from soil base cation depletion by acid deposition (Adams et al. 1992). Finally, although red maple appears to be increasing in abundance throughout most of its range in eastern North America (Abrams 1998), this species shows no signs of expanding in the HB valley.\nAnnual net change in aboveground biomass of 19 tree species across the entire Hubbard Brook Valley in first decade of 21st century. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals and numbers in parentheses are importance values.\nFigure 6. Annual net change in aboveground biomass of 19 tree species across the entire Hubbard Brook Valley in first decade of 21st century. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals and numbers in parentheses are importance values.\nForest composition and its trends differ considerably between the south-facing experimental watersheds and the larger Hubbard Brook Valley. The relative dominance of sugar maple has been steadily declining on W6 since the 1980s (Figure 6-2). The fact that calcium remediation on W1 reversed this decline clearly implicates acid rain in this decline. Conversely, the relative dominance of American beech steadily increased until recently, reflecting in part reduced competition from sugar maple. The role of beech bark disease in mediating these patterns is complex, as explained in detail in chapter The Trouble with Beech. Note also that yellow birch is much less abundant in the experimental watersheds than the larger valley and shows no clear sign of decline, even most recently increasing on W6 perhaps responding to maple decline.\nThirty years of change in the relative dominance (proportion of total basal area) for three dominant tree species on reference watershed 6 and Ca-treated W1 based on 5-year surveys of all stems on the watershed.

Thirty years of change in the relative dominance (proportion of total basal area) for three dominant tree species on reference watershed 6 and Ca-treated W1 based on 5-year surveys of all stems on the watershed. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.\nTree Reproduction Ecology\nThe regeneration cycle of forest trees includes seed production and dispersal; seed dormancy, germination and establishment; understory tolerance and release and; vegetative reproduction. Most of these features are quite well understood in general for the dominant tree species in the HB valley. Pulsed seed production is observed for most trees, as illustrated for two of the three dominant trees at HB, sugar maple and American beech (Figure 7). This behavior is interpreted as so-called “masting” for large-seeded species like beech, selected to satiate the mammalian seed predators that also serve as dispersal agents. The reasons for pulsed seed production of a tiny-seeded species like yellow birch is not conclusively known but could include greater efficiency of pollination.Dispersal limitation of HB tree species varies with the dispersal mechanism and typical dispersal distance of their seeds. At one extreme, the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds of birches exhibit little dispersal limitation in their spatial pattern (Schwarz et al. 2003). In contrast, dispersal distance of beech seeds that rely on small mammals is usually limited to a few tens of meters, explaining the species limited regeneration by seed after large-scale disturbance (e.g., logging of WS2 and WS5 at HB; Hughes and Fahey 1988). The importance of “safe-sites” for germination and establishment also varies with seed size, with tiny-seeded birches being restricted to exposed mineral soil or decaying logs where moisture retention is sufficient. Even on so-called safe sites, most germinants of all species soon die, often from damage by fungal pathogens and invertebrates such as slugs and insects (Cleavitt et al. 2011). However, it only takes a small percentage of survivors to maintain a bank of seedlings in the forest understory (Marks and Gardescu 1998), poised to take advantage of any disturbance to the canopy trees that will release them from severe competition and resource limitation.\nA particularly intriguing regeneration strategy is exhibited by pin cherry, as studied in detail at HB (Marks 1974, Thurston et al. 1992). The seeds of this extremely shade-intolerant species can remain viable in a dormant seed bank in the soil for many decades. Pin cherry only germinates when a large canopy opening has occurred creating a change in enviromental conditions such as high light, soil temperature fluctuation and changes in soil nitrate. The seedlings grow very quickly in this high resource environment and soon begin flowering and fruiting, replenishing the seed bank. At HB the density of pin cherry in the seed bank apparently grew exponentially in response to the repeated disturbances in the late 19th and 20th century (Tierney and Fahey 1998).\nFigure 7.

This figure is updated with current data available in the Environmental Data Initiative Repository (Fahey, T. and N. Cleavitt. 2025. Tree Seed Data at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, 1993 - ongoing ver 4. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/19e69d787124d60ccdfede1b5b813061). Hover over graph to access interactive controls available at the top right (zoom/pan/etc).\nAll the deciduous trees in the HB forest are capable of vegetative reproduction by basal sprouting and some also by root sprouting (beech, aspen) and stem layering (striped maple). None of the conifers exhibit vegetative sprouting, although at higher elevations stem layering occurs in balsam fir. In theory, the role of vegetative reproduction is to allow a species to persist at a location when dispersal and genetic recombination are not possible. The competitive interaction between seedlings and sprouters varies depending upon species, site and canopy disturbance. At HB, American beech root sprouting is of particular interest: it reproduces mostly by root sprouting at higher elevations at HB, but seed reproduction is common on more favorable sites (Cleavitt et al. 2008). Root sprouting is stimulated by damage to mother trees and their root systems (Jones and Raynal 1987) and prolific sprouting (“beech hell”) is observed across the HB valley. Some evidence suggests that this process has contributed to limited regeneration of sugar maple (Hane 2003). Disturbance Ecology\nThe northern hardwood-conifer forest is dominated by shade tolerant tree species (sugar maple, beech, spruce, fir, hemlock) that rely on advanced regeneration of seedlings that persists beneath the closed forest canopy and are able to supply recruits when death of individual or small groups of overstory trees provide canopy gaps. However, intolerant (paper birch) and mid-tolerant species (yellow birch, white ash, red maple) also are abundant in the mature forest. Unlike many other North American forest regions, natural fires are uncommon in the northern hardwood region, with point return intervals exceeding approximately 3,000 years (Lorimer and White 2003). Thus, the dynamics of shifting-mosaic steady state forest (Bormann and Likens 1979) depends on other causes of tree mortality. Based on the typical lifespans of the dominant species, in a forest where canopy recruits are derived primarily from death of individual trees through senescence, the point recurrence of canopy gaps would be a few hundred years. The prevalence of pit-and-mound micro-topography is suggestive of the important role of windstorms that causes tip-ups of large trees.\nFigure 8. Scene from the center of a large blowdown that occurred in June 2013 at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. (Photo credit: Natalie Cleavitt)\nFigure 8. Scene from the center of a large blowdown that occurred in June 2013 at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. (Photo credit: Natalie Cleavitt)\nFigure 9. Tree damage from the January 1999 ice storm.\nFigure 9. Tree damage from the January 1999 ice storm.\nA variety of storms in the Northeast are capable of uprooting or snapping mature trees: hurricanes; extra-tropical cyclonic storms; tornadoes; and downbursts and other straight-line winds associated with thunderstorms that accompany strong cold fronts (Peterson 2000). Lorimer and White (2003) concluded that point recurrence of large disturbances from windstorms exceeded 1,000 years for inland Northeast, considerably longer than for coastal areas visited more frequently by Atlantic hurricanes. Nevertheless, these intense windstorms can create gaps exceeding 0.1 ha and certainly provided plenty of opportunities for maintaining populations of intolerant and mid-tolerant species, as indicated by the high abundance of yellow birch even in the virgin forests at the Bowl and in Adirondack old-growth forests (Martin and Bailey 1999). At HB the legacy of the 1938 hurricane, as well as a recent downburst that created several gaps exceeding 1.0 ha in area, in and near HB (Figure 8.), are emblematic of this role. In contrast, although a severe ice storm in 1998 caused widespread canopy damage at HB (Rhoads et al. 2002; Figure 9.), it provided only minimal regeneration and recruitment opportunities because resprouting in the damaged canopy returned the forest LAI to pre-disturbance levels within three years (Weeks et al. 2009). Thus, ice storms, as well as unusual tree mortality resulting from species-specific pests and pathogens, can be considered diffuse disturbances that do not create large, discrete canopy gaps favoring less shade tolerant species. However, anticipated mortality of hemlock due to hemlock wooly adelgid infestation (Eschtruth et al. 2013) can be expected to create many large openings because it forms some nearly pure stands in the lower HB valley (Figure 4). Human-Accelerated Environmental Change\nSince the mid-20th century, the physical and biotic environment of the NE region has been rapidly changing. In particular, atmospheric CO2 concentration is increasing; the climate is getting warmer and wetter (see Climate Change chapter). Atmospheric deposition of sulfuric acid increased to a peak in the 1970s and has declined since (Driscoll et al. 2001); deposition of total nitrogen peaked at the turn of the century and has been declining recently (Lloret and Valiela, 2016) and several exotic pests and pathogens have or soon will invade the forest.\nThe effects of acid deposition, and consequent depletion of soil base cations, has clearly impacted the health of the HB forest. Experimental restoration of soil Ca on WS1 ameliorated red spruce winter injury (Hawley et al. 2006), corrected canopy decline symptoms of sugar maple, and stimulated forest aboveground productivity (Battles et al. 2014). It also favored sugar maple seedling survival and growth (Juice et al. 2006). Further striking evidence about the effects of soil calcium depletion on sugar maple is the virtual disappearance of this iconic species from the regrowing forest on W5 after the experimental whole-tree harvest in 1984. The removal of biomass significantly depleted soil base cations, most severely in the upper slope positions. In the thirty years following the harvest the relative abundance of sugar maple, originally the dominant species on the watershed, declined precipitously especially on the upper slopes (Cleavitt et al. 2018). The broader response of forest composition to current reductions in acid and N loading will be difficult to detect in the face of many other changes, and the effects of atmospheric deposition of N on forest growth and health are not conclusively known, although recent evidence suggests a possible switch from N to P limitation of tree growth (Goswami et al., unpublished data)\nNative insects have occasionally caused widespread defoliation at HB, but the effects of these pests on forest composition and structure are less profound than for exotic insects. Most notable to date has been the beech bark disease which first appeared at HB in the 1970s and has caused high mortality throughout the HB valley. A complex, ongoing response is anticipated as this insect-fungus disease complex has entered the aftermath phase (Houston 1975), and prolific vegetative sprouts begin to dominate the canopy in many areas. In the immediate future, hemlock wooly adelgid and emerald ash borer are poised to invade HB in the next decade. Although neither hemlock nor white ash is among the most abundant species in the HB valley, their loss will cause some local re-sorting of forest structure and composition. Hemlock is a dominant species in the lower HB valley and its mortality is likely to facilitate the colonization of white pine and red oak (see below). White ash is locally abundant on richer soils, and we anticipate that its mortality will favor sugar maple.\nFinally, the climate at HB is becoming gradually warmer and wetter, but the consequences of these changes are highly uncertain. For example, despite increased temperatures and growing season length at HB (see Climate Change chapter), the two species that have exhibited the greatest increase in abundance in recent years are balsam fir and red spruce (van Doorn et al. 2011), trees that would be predicted to recede to higher elevations in a warming climate. Some evidence also suggests that the striking decline of paper birch at HB may be linked to drought stress, even though annual average precipitation has increased by 20% since the mid-20th century; high temperatures and periodic summer droughts appear to contravene the precipitation trend. Nevertheless, we do see some clear signs of local climate warming as two species from warmer site are colonizing the HB valley, red oak and white pine (Figure 10). Whether these species are successful at recruiting into the forest canopy will only be apparent in longer term, but the imminent decline of hemlock and white ash could be crucial to their success.\nFigure 10. Seedling colonization by read oak (QURU) and white pine (PIST) into the lower valley at Hubbard Brook Exerimental forest in 2015. (J. J. Battles, unpublished data).\nFigure 10. Seedling colonization by read oak (QURU) and white pine (PIST) into the lower valley at Hubbard Brook Exerimental forest in 2015. (J. J. Battles, unpublished data).\nQuestions for Further Study\nHow will forest composition and structure respond to continuing climate change, especially increasing air temperature and summer precipitation?\nWhat was the role of large-scale natural disturbances (vs. single-tree replacement) in shaping the composition and structure of pre-Industrial northern hardwoods forests\nWhat species will replace white ash and hemlock following expected mass mortality?\nWhat factors facilitate the colonization of white pine and red oak in the lower valley?\nWhat differences characterize the demography and distribution of paper birch and mountain paper birch, and how does their recent mass mortality affect the dynamics of associated species?\nHow will the continuing declines of the three dominant species – yellow birch, sugar maple, American beech – affect the future composition and structure of the HB forest?\nIn the long-term how will the restoration of ecosystem calcium affect forest composition on WS1?\nWill base cation depletion resulting from whole-tree harvest of WS5 have significant effects on forest composition?\nAccess Data\nFahey, T. and N.
