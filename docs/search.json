    "text": "Introduction\nThis online book is designed as a concise but comprehensive synthesis of the HBES. Many readers will be interested to see the award-winning book by Richard Holmes and Gene Likens entitled, Hubbard Brook: The Story Of A Forest Ecosystem, a synthesis of the HBES for a general audience. Advanced readers are directed to the book, Biogeochemistry of a Forested Ecosystem (2013) by Gene Likens as well as the series of detailed element monographs published in the journal Biogeochemistry (Likens et al. 1994 (K), 1998 (Ca), 2002 (S); Fahey et al. 2005 (C); and Lovett et al. 2005 (Cl)). The synthesis is presented at the level of a graduate or advanced undergraduate student audience. The primary objective of the book is to introduce students and other prospective researchers to the current state of knowledge about the Hubbard Brook ecosystem. The chapters have been developed by scientific experts on each of the topics studied in the HBES, and they will be updated and expanded as new knowledge and data are generated by the HBES – it is meant to be a living volume. Links to the broader literature and to HBES data sets are provided to facilitate more detailed explorations. Teaching and learning exercises that utilize data from the HBES will be added as they are developed by our experts for academic use.\n\n\n\n1. Site, History, and Research Approaches\nFor over 60 years scientists have been studying the dynamics of forests and linked aquatic ecosystems in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study (HBES) is an ongoing effort to understand the ecology, hydrology, energetics and biogeochemistry of this temperate forest ecosystem. The synthesis that follows provides an overview of several components of the HBES interpreted in light of current understanding at the level of the advanced student.\n\n\n\n2. Climate Change\nThe Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) was established well before the issue of climate change emerged. However, many of the long-term measurements collected at the site have become valuable climate change indicators (Table 1). Perhaps any of these records would not be all that informative on their own, but combined they provide fairly convincing evidence of climate change at the HBEF that is compatible with regional trends in the northeastern U.S. (Hayhoe et al. 2007; Milillo et al. 2014).",

The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study (HBES) is an ongoing effort to understand the ecology, hydrology, energetics and biogeochemistry of this temperate forest ecosystem. The synthesis that follows provides an overview of several components of the HBES interpreted in light of current understanding at the level of the advanced student. The objective is to provide interested researchers with a succinct summary that will be helpful for guiding research and education efforts.\nThe Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) is located in the southern part of the White Mountain National Forest (WMNF) in central New Hampshire (Figure 1.1). The HBEF is characteristic of much of the White Mountain National Forest (Fahey et al. 2015) The National Forest has hilly, occasionally steep topography; coarse, acidic, glacially-derived soils; bedrock dominated by metamorphic rock of igneous and sedimentary origin; northern hardwood forests on lower slopes and spruce-fir forests at higher elevations (above ca. 800 m).",

    "section": "1.2 Climate",
    "text": "1.2 Climate\nThe continental climate at the HBEF features long, cold winters and mild to cool summers (see Climate chapter). Major air flow over the forest is either (1) continental polar air from subarctic North America (the predominant direction), (2) maritime tropical air from the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico from the south or southwest, or (3) maritime air from the North Atlantic out of the east or northeast. In spite of the proximity of Hubbard Brook to the ocean (116 km), the climate is predominantly continental.\nAnnual precipitation averages about 1,400 mm, of which about one third to one quarter is snow. A snowpack usually persists from mid-December until mid-April, with a peak depth in March of about 1,000 mm, having about 250 to 300 mm of water content.\nWinters are long and cold. January averages about -9oC, and long periods of low temperatures from -12˚C to -18˚C are common. Even though temperatures are low most of the time, occasional midwinter thaws result in elevated streamflow. Short, cool summers are the rule. The average July temperature is 18oC.\nThe average number of days without killing frost is 145; however, the growing season for trees is considered to be from 15 May, the approximate time of full leaf development, to 15 September, when the leaves begin to fall.\nThe estimated annual evapotranspiration (ET) is about 500 mm, determined by difference between precipitation and streamflow. This calculation is a reasonable approach for Hubbard Brook because of the apparent minimal deep seepage and annual removal of summer soil-water deficits by autumnal rains and spring snowmelt.",

    "text": "1.3 Geology\nThe eastern portion of the Experimental Forest (watersheds 1-6, and 9 included; Figure 1) is underlain by a complex assemblage of metasedimentary and igneous rocks. The major map unit is the Silurian Rangeley Formation, consisting of quartz mica schist and quartzite interbedded with sulfidic schist and calc-silicate granulite. Originally deposited as mudstones, sandstones and conglomerates, these rocks have been metamorphosed to sillimanite grade and have undergone four stages of deformation. Deformation style evident in outcrops is primarily tight isoclinal folds. However joints, slickensides and mylonites indicate brittle deformation as well. The metamorphic rocks were later intruded by a variety of igneous rocks including the Devonian Concord Granite, pegmatites, and Mesozoic diabase and lamprophyre dikes. The western portion of the forest (portions of watersheds 7 and 8 included) is underlain by the Devonian Kinsman Granodiorite, a foliated granitic rock with megacrysts of potassium feldspar.\nContinental glaciers, which blanketed the region during the Pleistocene and retreated some 13,000 years ago, removed most preexisting soils. Glacial movement was primarily in a southeasterly direction as indicated by striations on bedrock surfaces, and by fragments of rocks in the till which are typical of bedrock to the northwest of the Hubbard Brook Valley. Materials deposited by the glacier are highly variable in degree of sorting and grain size, ranging from clays to 10m diameter boulders. The depth of glacial deposits ranges from zero on ridgetops and in stream valleys (resulting in bedrock outcrops) to 50m in the vicinity of Mirror Lake. Poorly sorted glacial till, commonly 2m thick, covers the bedrock in most of the valley. Ice contact terraces in the lower valley, consisting of well sorted sands and gravels, are typically tens of meters thick.",

    "text": "1.4 Soils\nIn the HBEF soils are predominantly well-drained Spodosols, more specifically, Typic Haplorthods derived from glacial till, with sandy loam textures. There are no residual soils, (i.e., derived from weathered bedrock). Principal soil series are the sandy loams of the Berkshire series, along with the Skerry, Becket, and Lyman series. These soils are acidic (pH about 4.5 or less) and relatively infertile (Table 1.1). A 20- to 200-mm thick forest floor layer is usually present. Soils on the ridgetops may consist of a thin accumulation of organic matter, resting directly on bedrock.\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Summary soils data for Watershed 5 at the HBEF (after Johnson et al. 1991a,b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil Type\nTypic Haplorthod; Typic Dystrochrept\n\n\n\nSoil Series\nBerkshire; Skerry; Becket; Lyman; Tunbridge\n\n\n\nProperty\nSurface / Organic Layer\nMineral Soil\n\n\n—-\n—-\n—-\n\n\nAvg.

Rocks of all sizes are scattered throughout the soil profile. In many locations boulder fields are prominent features.\nA prominent feature of the surface topography throughout the HBEF is the rough pit-and-mound appearance caused by the uprooting of trees. Uprooting mixes mineral soil from lower mineral horizons with nutrient-rich organic surface layers or it can deposit the lower mineral layers directly on top of the forest floor humus layers without mixing, creating buried horizons. This natural disturbance changes seedbed conditions for regenerating species, and affects weathering and biogeochemical cycles.",

    "text": "1.5 Streams\nAlthough stream channels occupy only 1% of the land area, the streams play an important role in many processes throughout the HBEF. The numerous streams in the HBEF range from small ephemeral channels that often dry up during summer to a large perennial 5th-order stream (Hubbard Brook). Because of the shallow soil depths and high soil porosity, the stream channels quickly swell during large storms (e.g., 80 mm or more). As much as 60 to 80% of storm precipitation can pass through the stream as storm flow.\nStreamwater is usually characterized by low concentrations of suspended materials due to the coarse-grained texture of the soil. Mineral and organic particulate material is suspended and carried in storm periods, but once the flow recedes these materials quickly settle, leaving the stream with low concentrations of suspended solids. About 28 kg/ha of particulate matter (both inorganic and organic) are transported out of the watershed by streams each year.\nMost of the stream channels have exposed bedrock at some locations. However, the first to third order streams have channels primarily made up of mineral and organic particulate matter lodged behind organic debris dams. These dams form a stair-step pattern in stream channels, and they play important roles in regulating many physical, chemical, and biological processes in the streams.",

    "section": "1.6 Historical Perspective",
    "text": "1.6 Historical Perspective\nThe Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest was established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service in 1955 as a major center for hydrologic research in New England. The initial size delineated for research was a 3,037-ha, bowl-shaped Valley (Figure 1).\nDuring the first eight years following the establishment of the HBEF, the Northeastern Research Station of the USDA Forest Service developed a network of precipitation and stream-gauging stations, and installed weather instrumentation, as well as soil and vegetation monitoring sites on small experimental watersheds. Data from these installations combined with several initial studies formed the hydrometeorologic foundation for much of the future research at the HBEF. The major emphasis in these early studies was to determine the impact of forest land management on water yield,water quality, and flood flow.\nThe Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study originated in 1960 with the idea of using a small watershed approach to study element flux and cycling. The initial development of the HBES was slow and deliberate. The entire effort during the first two years, 1963-1965, was conducted by three scientists and one technician at Dartmouth College and three scientists and one technician from the USDA Forest Service (USDA-FS). At that time, there were no precedents to follow since comprehensive studies of ecosystems had not been initiated. Using the small watershed approach, studies of element-hydrologic interactions were conducted to form a basis for subsequent process-level and experimental research. In this regard, the investigators were fortunate to rather quickly develop quantitative element budgets for replicated ecosystems. These results provided insight into the function of natural ecosystems and helped focus future lines of research. It was agreed that slow growth would be more manageable and would allow for interaction among all senior investigators, ensuring proper coordination and development of the overall study. Research problems that were timely and particularly pertinent to the overall research goals of the study were identified. From the beginning, the HBES has emphasized the value of knowledge derived from cooperative research. At the same time, individual research freedom has always been encouraged among both cooperating scientists and graduate students. This policy has been largely responsible for the intellectual growth of the HBES, as well as its role as a center for undergraduate and graduate education in ecosystem science.\nHBES has developed into a relatively complex matrix of projects involving a large number of scientists from diverse disciplines. Beginning in 1987, core funding for the HBES has been provided through the Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) network of the National Science Foundation. Together with support from the USDA Forest Service, the LTER program provides base funding for most monitoring activities in the HBES. Individuals or groups of researchers are supported by competitive grants to pursue a variety of specific research studies in the HBES in cooperation with the LTER program. From 1963, over 1750 publications have been produced through the HBES, providing a wealth of information on the structure, function and development of forest, stream and lake ecosystems.\nFor more history of Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest: Events Leading to the Establishment of the HBEF, written by Jim Hornbeck, May 2001 (pdf)",

    "section": "1.7 Conceptual Background",
    "text": "1.7 Conceptual Background\nThe mission of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study is to improve understanding of the response of northern forest ecosystems to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. In the overall conceptual model underlying the Study (Figure 1.2), three types of disturbances - changing atmospheric chemistry, climate, and biota - drive changes in the interacting components of the ecosystem, including vegetation, biogeochemistry, hydrology, and food webs. These changes play out on a template that includes the biogeophysical characteristics of the landscape. The ecosystem responses may feedback to modify the template and alter biotic change. The template and the functional responses change through time in response to the disturbances and internal drivers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Conceptual model underlying the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study\n\n\n\nIn Figure 1.3 we illustrate measured and hypothesized changes in ecosystem concentrations and fluxes in response to long-term decreases in S and N atmospheric deposition and increases in CO2 concentrations. Up and down arrows indicate increases and decreases. Gold arrows reflect measured changes, purple arrows show hypothesized changes. Gray arrows indicate major ecosystem processes driving other responses in the ecosystem. We have observed increases in soil pH and base saturation in response to declining S and N deposition and expect these changes to increase soil P availability. We have also observed increases in soil microbial biomass, decreases in forest floor organic matter stocks, and shifts in solution N losses from inorganic to organic forms. We hypothesize that rising atmospheric CO2 contributes to these changes by stimulating plant CO2 uptake and nutrient demand for growth, which in turn drives an increase in plant N and P uptake from solution, increased nutrient resorption from litter and decreased litter C/N ratios, as well as increases in allocation of plant C belowground to spur organic matter mineralization and soil respiration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Illustration of measured and hypothesized changes in ecosystem concentrations and fluxes in response to long-term decreases in S and N atmospheric deposition and increases in CO2 concentrations.\n\n\n\nClimate change disturbance has myriad effects on forest ecosystem dynamics. Here we highlight (Figure 1.4) a conceptual framework for diagnosing the cause of the recent observed increase in rates of evapotranspiration (ET) at Hubbard Brook (see Hydrology Chapter). We are investigating how atmospheric conditions and vegetation interact nonlinearly to affect ET. Orange arrows indicate observed trends in the long-term data. Question marks show where there is uncertainty in our understanding. The green arrow shows how the coupling of canopy and aerodynamic resistance affects rates of evapotranspiration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: A conceptual framework for diagnosing the cause of the recent observed increase in rates of evapotranspiration (ET) at Hubbard Brook.\n\n\n\nOur conceptual model of the hierarchical response of ecosystem function to chronic stressors and episodic events is illustrated in Figure 1.5). (A) Initial responses to stress trigger species-specific responses with limited system-wide impact. (B) With continued exposure, species abundances begin to re-order, resulting in reduced ecosystem function. (C) This slow loss of function can be accelerated by an (D) episodic disturbance. (E) If the stress persists, further changes in the biota are expected. These disturbance-driven shifts in biodiversity will have profound consequences on species additions and losses, species demography and evolution, and energy flow (inset).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The conceptual model of the hierarchical response of ecosystem function to chronic stressors and episodic events.\n\n\n\nOur conceptual model of the biogeophysical template on an idealized hillslope (Figure 1.6) shows five slope positions along a depth-to-bedrock gradient that results in predictable variation in soils, shallow groundwater movement, and saturation frequency. Hydro-bio-pedo interactions along these soil-slope variations structure vegetation and other biota, form linkages with temporary and perennial streams, and shape the complex functional responses of ecosystem components (Figure 1.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: The conceptual model of the biogeophysical template on an idealized hillslope.",

    "text": "1.8 Research Approaches\nThe framework for the HBES is the small watershed approach which provides precise quantitative water and element input-output budgets for the forested ecosystems. In a catchment where the underlying bedrock is impermeable, water falling on the catchment leaves only by evapotranspiration (ET) or as stream discharge. By quantifying the latter, annual ET can be calculated by difference:\nEq. 1. AET = Precipitation – stream discharge\nFor chemical elements without a gas phase at Earth temperature, the small watershed also allows estimation of soil weathering (Johnson et al. 1981):\nEq. 2. Weathering = stream output – atmospheric input + ∆ storage\nHere, the stream output and atmospheric input of an element are determined as the product of water flux and the element concentration in the water. The ∆ storage term refers to any change in the stock or pool of an element in the soil organic matter or vegetation biomass in the ecosystem. For example, when vegetation biomass is aggrading some of the chemicals weathered from soil minerals are accumulating in the trees rather than lost in stream discharge and the ∆ storage term is positive in Equation 2. Also, some elements enter the ecosystems as dry rather than wet deposition (e.g. dust particles), and this flux is included in the atmospheric input term.\nFor elements with gaseous phases (e.g., N, C), separate measurements of gas fluxes in and out of the ecosystem are needed to estimate material budgets (see below). Experimental manipulations (e.g., forest harvest, fertilization) can be applied at the small watershed scale to quantify whole ecosystem responses (Bormann et al. 1974). The internal processes determining the whole ecosystem responses are measured at the plot scale at selected locations within or nearby the small watershed. Together these measurements form the basis for much of the research in the HBES including long-term monitoring as detailed below.",

Measurement of wet deposition has been conducted on a weekly basis since 1963 at a network of sampling sites across the HBEF (Figure 7). All major dissolved solutes are measured and together with precipitation water volume from standard rain gauges, element fluxes in wet deposition are determined.\nDry deposition of particles and gases is more difficult to quantify than wet deposition and can constitute a substantial proportion of the input of several important elements, especially nitrogen and sulfur, that are derived partly from pollutant emissions. Some of the dry deposition can be captured on artificial samplers or as canopy throughfall, but the calculation of dry deposition flux is complex and uncertain, and we refer the reader to detailed explanations in the literature (Likens et al. 2002).",

The weirs continuously measure stage height in a stilling pond above the weir outlet. Each weir is calibrated by directly measuring the relationship between stage height and water flux. To calculate element fluxes, water samples for chemical analysis are collected weekly just above each weir. More frequent measurements to more precisely quantify storm-event fluxes have been conducted periodically using automated samplers. Flux of particulate matter is measured by removing accumulated material in the weir stilling pond periodically. The flux of fine suspended solids during large storm events also has been measured using permeable bags positioned below the weir.",

The basic approach is to measure the diameter of trees across the whole watershed (e.g., WS6, WS1) or in smaller plots usually at five-year intervals. Forest biomass is estimated using allometric equations relating DBH to other tree dimensions (e.g. total biomass and biomass of tissue components like leaves, branches, etc.). These equations were developed at the site by directly measuring trees harvested during experimental manipulations (Whittaker et al. 1974, Siccama et al. 1994). The pool or stock of an element is estimated from the product of mass and element concentration in various tissues. Thus, changes in the stock of an element in the forest biomass are calculated typically at a 5-year intervals.",

Because of the large stocks and high spatial variability of elements in soil, detection of changes through time or in response to treatments is challenging.

Gaseous flux of N remains a key uncertainty in the N budget at the HBEF (Yanai et al. 2013). The principal gaseous flux of N results from denitrification, a process that is notoriously variable in space and time. The flux chamber approach, in which the accumulation of gaseous N diffusing from soil is measured over short time intervals (e.g. minutes), is applied routinely to estimate flux of nitrous oxide in several plots in and around the experimental watersheds at the HBEF. Unfortunately, because of the high background in the atmosphere this approach is not effective for measuring N2 flux. Laboratory, isotopic and modeling approaches have provided indirect estimates of N2 flux from soils (e.g., Wexler et al. 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Photograph of flux tower instrumentation at Hubbard Brook.\n\n\n\n\nFluxes of carbon dioxide and water vapor from the forest ecosystem can be estimated using aerodynamic approaches with eddy flux towers. Recently, an eddy flux tower has been installed in the lower valley at the HBEF and began collecting data in 2016 (Figure 1.9). The facility will soon provide the first direct estimates of gross primary production, autotrophic and total ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem productivity for the forest in the footprint of the tower.",

In particular, element leaching through soils is measured using zero-tension lysimeters positioned beneath the forest floor, Bh and Bs horizons. Water fluxes at each depth, estimated with a hydrologic model, are used with measured element concentrations in soil solutions to estimate soil leaching fluxes (Cho et al. 2010).\nLitterfall is measured using permanent litter traps co-located in plots with soil lysimeters. Litter is sorted by species, providing annual estimates of leaf biomass and leaf area index in these plots. Periodically, the chemistry of leaf litter is measured; combined with chemistry of live foliage from the plots, these measurements provide estimates of nutrient resorption from senescing foliage, a large internal ecosystem flux especially for N and P (Ryan and Bormann 1982). Deposition of woody litter as coarse woody debris is measured annually on cleared 2.5 m2 plots co-located with litter traps. The chemistry of canopy throughfall and element fluxes in canopy leaching also have been measured in these intensive plots (Lovett et al. 1996) as well as the biomass, chemistry and turnover of fine and coarse roots, using coring and rhizotron methods, so that a comprehensive accounting of the principal internal element fluxes is available for the forest ecosystems in the experimental watersheds.",

    "text": "2.1 Background\nChapter Editor: John Campbell\nThe Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest () was established well before the issue of climate change emerged. However, many of the long-term measurements collected at the site have become valuable climate change indicators (Table 2.1). Although these records might not provide information relative to climate change separately, combined they provide convincing evidence of climate change at the HBEF that is compatible with regional trends in the northeastern U.S. (Hayhoe et al. 2007; Melillo et al. 2014). A summary of the climatic characteristics of the HBEF most suitable for inclusion in research reports can be found in the Introduction chapter of this book.\nNone of the long-term measurements at the HBEF were initiated for studying climate alone, but rather were collected to help understand other topics such as streamflow, biogeochemical dynamics, and forest growth. Some of the hydrometeorological measurements were initiated because of a need for data as input for computer models, most notably the BROOK model. BROOK was pioneering when it was first developed in the 1970’s and is still in wide-use today (Federer 2015). As a result, compared to most other similar research sites, the hydrometeorological records from the HBEF are long and comprehensive.\nAlthough climate data at the HBEF are rich by most standards, there are some limitations that need to be considered when evaluating long-term trends. Perhaps most importantly, the methods for some of the measurements have changed over the years. For many years, the continuous measurements at the HBEF were made with analog devices, which have now all been replaced with digital sensors. In some cases, changes in instrumentation have been relatively seamless with negligible effects on the long term record, whereas in other cases the transitions have not been smooth. For example, the anemometer at the U.S. Forest Service Headquarters building malfunctioned in 2004 and was replaced with a different model with no period of overlap for correction, resulting in a step function in wind speed. Other records contain long gaps when instruments were not functioning (e.g., solar radiation, relative humidity). These types of problems cannot always be corrected reliably, hampering our ability to evaluate trends. Nevertheless, a large number of records at the HBEF have been collected consistently at the same locations using the same methods with the same or comparable instruments. In this chapter, we focus on a few of the measurements with which we have a high level of confidence and are well-suited for evaluating climate change.\nThe trends in this chapter were analyzed with the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, which is commonly applied to analyses of long-term hydrometeorological data (Kendall, 1938; Helsel and Hirsch, 1992). One of the advantages of this test is that it is rank-based, making it suitable for non-normally distributed data, data containing outliers and non-linear trends such as those often encountered in long-term hydrometeorological research. The slope for each trend was calculated as the median of all possible pair-wise slopes (Sen, 1968).",

    "section": "2.2 Air Temperature",
    "text": "2.2 Air Temperature\nAir temperature has been measured at seven locations at the HBEF; one location at the U.S. Forest Service Headquarters building (HQ) and six locations in the vicinity of the gaged watersheds (Bailey et al. 2003; see also Introduction chapter, Figure 1). Air temperature measurements have been collected for various time periods at different locations beginning shortly after the establishment of the HBEF in 1955. The oldest records are from Station 1 (STA1) and HQ, which respectively began in 1956 and 1957.\nLong-term mean annual air temperature ranges from 3.7 to 6.7 °C across the seven sites where it is measured, and generally increases with elevation slightly more than the adiabatic lapse rate (0.5 vs 0.6 °C degrees per 100 m. At STA1, mean monthly air temperature ranges from a high of 19 °C in July to a low of -8 °C in January. The highest mean daily temperature ever recorded was 37 °C in on July 22, 2011 at HQ and the low was -36 °C on January 23, 1976 at STA14.\nFigure 1. Change in the frequency of days in each air temperature class at the HBEF. Values are frequency of days in each bin between 1986 and 2005 expressed as a percentage change from its frequency between 1958 and 1977. (Hamburg et al. 2013).\nFigure 1.

Values are frequency of days in each bin between 1986 and 2005 expressed as a percentage change from its frequency between 1958 and 1977. (Hamburg et al. 2013).\nObservations show an overall warming trend at the HBEF, with air temperatures increasing by about 1.4 °C over the past 60 years at STA1. Air temperature increases have been recorded across all seasons, but winter temperatures have risen the most, with average winter temperatures warming by 2.0 °C since 1956. Fall temperatures have warmed the least, amounting to 0.9 °C over this period. Daily minimum temperatures, which typically occur at night, have risen by an average of 1.7 °C, while daily maximum temperatures have risen by 1.3 °C since 1956. The number of warm days has increased slightly at the HBEF, whereas the number of extremely cold days has decreased (Figure 1). The loss of extremely cold days is one of the most striking observations in the air temperature record, and has important biological implications. For example, cold snaps during winter keep insect populations in check, and are especially important for limiting the spread of invasive species northward. Warmer winter temperatures may remove barriers to both native and non-native species, potentially resulting in declines in forest health and changes in species composition.",

    "section": "2.3 Precipitation",
    "text": "2.3 Precipitation\nPrecipitation is collected at a network of gages surrounding the area of the experimental watersheds and at the main headquarters (HQ) (for further details on instrumentation, see Bailey et al. 2003). In 2017, the network was reduced from 24 to 11 gages in an effort to reduce costs by improving the efficiency of the monitoring program (Green et al. in review). Like air temperature, the records of precipitation vary in length, with the oldest dating back to 1956 at stations 1-4.\nLong-term mean annual precipitation ranges from 1326 to 1607 mm across the 24 gages where it has been measured. There is a slight increase in precipitation with elevation and there is also a slight increase from east to west (Bailey et al. 2003). In general, precipitation is frequent at the HBEF, and some form of measurable precipitation occurs in about one out of every three days. Unlike many other regions, precipitation is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year and does not follow a strong seasonal pattern. About 30% of annual precipitation falls as snow. The biggest precipitation event ever recorded began on June 28, 1973 and dropped over 17 cm of rain in 57 hours.\nThe annual volume of precipitation has been increasing at the HBEF, amounting to a total increase of about 300 mm since 1956 (Figure 2). Interestingly, there has been no significant increase in winter precipitation, and the increases in annual precipitation are attributed to increases that have occurred during the other three seasons. This finding differs from future climate change projections for the northeastern U.S., which predict greater increases in winter precipitation during the 21st century, and little to no change in summer precipitation (Hayhoe et al. 2007). Determining the reasons for this apparent disagreement between recent trends and model projections presents an important challenge for regional climatology.\nFigure 2. Trends an annual precipitation at the HBEF compared to the regional average (i.e., Bethlehem and Hanover, NH, and St. Johnsbury, VT). Data from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/). This figure is updated with current data available in the Environmental Data Initiative Repository (EDI; https://portal.edirepository.org) and at NOAA NCEI. Hover over graph to access interactive controls available at the top right (zoom/pan/etc).\nCompared to air temperature, precipitation is more variable from year-to-year, and these increasing trends in precipitation are only significant at gages with longer records (Campbell et al. 2010). It should be noted that the rain gages that have been in operation the longest also captured a period of drought in the 1960’s. This was a well-documented multi-year drought that had major impacts in the northeastern U.S. (Namias 1966). In recent decades there has been a shift toward a wet phase. Consequently, the longest precipitation records at the HBEF are bookended by a dry period at the beginning of the record and a wet period at the end of the record. The increases in precipitation that have been observed at the HBEF for this time period are slightly greater than increases in the broader region, and annual precipitation at the HBEF and broader region is greater now than ever before in recorded history.\nIn addition to changes in mean values, there is also evidence supporting increases in extreme precipitation events. The number of days per year with heavy precipitation, defined as days with more than ≥ 20 mm of rain, has increased significantly by about 7.4 days since 1956. This trend is consistent with observations from other locations across the northeastern U.S. showing a 70% increase in “extremely heavy storms” since the 1950s, as reported in the 2014 National Climate Assessment (Melillo et al. 2014).\nNot surprisingly, increased precipitation has led to an increase in soil moisture (Groffman et al. 2012), with potential impacts on many different ecological processes. Because soil biota are so strongly influenced by available water, increases in soil moisture can enhance decomposition, mineralization, trace gas fluxes, and solute export. Additionally, the major flooding events that have occurred at the HBEF tend to happen when substantial rains fall on soils that have already been saturated from a previous storm. Therefore, these wetter conditions can increase the likelihood of major flooding events with potential economic and societal impacts. Moreover, an increase in the extent and duration of local saturation of soils could result in changes in the occurrence of anaerobic onditions and consequent microbial processes such as denitrification.",

    "section": "2.4 Snowpack and Soil Frost",
    "text": "2.4 Snowpack and Soil Frost\nSnowpack has been measured under the forest canopy at 21 locations for various time periods at the HBEF; however, only 5 of these sites have been monitored over the long-term and are still in operation today. The snowpack is measured weekly along a snow course that consists of 10 points spaced 2 m apart. At each point, field technicians use a Mt. Rose snow tube to measure the depth of the snow, and also to extract and weigh a core of the snowpack to determine the snow water equivalent (SWE). Snow water equivalent is a measure of the amount of water contained in the snowpack and is more temporally stable and hydrologically meaningful than snow depth. Manual measurements of soil frost are made weekly at a single point adjacent to the snow courses. Technicians dig through the snow, use a hatchet to cut through the frozen soil, look and feel where the frost line is, and measure the total depth from the surface of the forest floor. Although both the snowpack and soil frost measurement methods are somewhat rudimentary, they are effective and have remained consistent over the entire records, providing confidence in observed trends over time.\nHistorically, the HBEF has had a continuous snowpack throughout the winter that on average persists from late December until mid-April, with a peak depth in March. Since air temperatures are getting warmer and the volume of precipitation in winter has not changed, it is not surprising that the snowpack has declined over the periood of record. The long-term average annual maximum snow depth and corresponding snow water equivalent (SWE) ranges from 47 cm (12 cm SWE) to 101 (27 cm SWE) at HQ and STA17, respectively. At STA2, which has the longest record (beginning in 1956), maximum annual snow depth has declined by 29 cm (9 cm SWE). The length of the snow-covered period is also getting shorter. On average there are 111 days with snow cover at STA1. The number of days with snow cover has declined by about 20 days over the record (Figure 3). The changes in the snowpack have resulted in shifts in hydrology (see Hydrology chapter for more detail). The annual hydrograph at the HBEF is characterized by low streamflow during winter as precipitation accumulates in the snowpack, followed by a snowmelt peak during spring runoff. The declining snowpack has caused a flattening of the hydrograph, due to more frequent melting events during winter that recharge groundwater, and a reduction in the spring peak caused by less snowpack accumulation and melt (Campbell et al. 2011).\nFigure 3. Long-term trends in the maximum annual snow depth, maximum annual snow water equivalent, and number of days with snow cover measured at weather station 2 at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. (Original figure in Campbell et al., 2007). This figure is updated with current data available in the Environmental Data Initiative Repository (EDI; https://portal.edirepository.org). Hover over graph to access interactive controls available at the top right (zoom/pan/etc).\nSoil frost is present approximately two out of every three years at the HBEF, depending on how cold it is at the onset of winter and when the snowpack begins to develop (Campbell et al. 2010). Once the ground is frozen, it generally stays frozen beneath the snowpack throughout the entire winter. The average annual maximum soil frost depth ranges from 2 cm at STA9 to 9 cm at HQ.\nThe deepest soil frost ever recorded was 30 cm in 1980 at STA17. Soil frost is highly variable from year-to-year at the HBEF and no long term trends are evident. However future climate change modeling done with HBEF data indicates that although the annual maximum depth of soil frost is not expected to change much in the future, the number of freeze-thaw events will increase and the number of days with soil frost will decline stemming from a concurrent decline in the number of snow-covered days (Campbell et al. 2010). These potential changes in soil frost regimes have important implications for forest ecosystem processes such as hydrological flowpaths during winter, biogeochemical processes in soil, and tree phenology and growth. For example, Mitchell et al. (1996) indicated that high nitrate loss from the HBEF watersheds followed severe soil frost events.",

    "section": "2.5 Vegetation",
    "text": "2.5 Vegetation\nClimate change has the potential to affect the growth, composition and health of vegetation in many ways. The HBEF lies on the northern hardwood and spruce-fir ecotone. On the warmer, lower elevation, south-facing watersheds, northern hardwoods comprise 83 to 99% of the forest cover, whereas the colder, higher elevation north-facing watersheds have a greater proportion of spruce-fir (73 to 97%; National Land Cover Dataset, Homer et al. 2015). It has been suggested that as the climate changes, spruce-fir should recede upslope, with northern hardwoods filling in behind it (Beckage et al. 2008). However, at the HBEF there is little evidence to support this with existing data. In fact, data from the HBEF (van Doorn et al. 2011) and the larger region indicate that spruce-fir is becoming more prevalent at lower elevations (Foster and D’Amato 2015). Undoubtedly, climate is one of many factors that influences tree species composition, but it is not clear how the combination of climate change with other changes will alter future vegetation assemblages.\nFigure 4. The vernal transition is defined as the period between the last day of snowpack and the day of full canopy expansion. This period is characterized by a sharp increase in soil temperature that triggers biological activity in soils. (Groffman et al., 2012).\nFigure 4. The vernal transition is defined as the period between the last day of snowpack and the day of full canopy expansion. This period is characterized by a sharp increase in soil temperature that triggers biological activity in soils. (Groffman et al., 2012).\nExtreme weather events are perhaps a more important influence on vegetation than subtle shifts in climate over time. These events are projected to increase in number and strength in the future, owing to more energy in the atmosphere. Some examples of documented extreme weather events at the HBEF with direct effects on vegetation include ice storms, hurricanes, microbursts, hail storms, droughts, floods, spring freeze events, fall snowfall events, and episodes of soil freezing. Additionally, changes in climate can open a Pandora’s box of indirect effects, such as outbreaks of pests and pathogens, and fire. Because of these complexities, there is much uncertainty about how climate change may affect vegetation at the HBEF in the future.\nMeasurements of plant phenology provide some of the most useful information for evaluating how climate change is affecting vegetation. Tree phenology is the study of the seasonal occurrence of developmental or life cycle events, such as budbreak, flowering, or autumn leaf drop. Measurements of phenology were initiated at the HBEF in 1989 at nine plots along an elevation gradient. Each spring and autumn, field technicians visit the plots and record the phenological stage of trees.\nThe record at the HBEF does not indicate that significant shifts in phenology have occurred during the period of observation. However, retrospective modeling of phenology does show evidence of a longer growing season (i.e., beginning in 1957 following Richardson et al. 2006). These modeled phenology data enable comparison of shifts in phenological phases with climate change drivers (Groffman et al. 2012). For example, during spring there is a vernal transition period between the time when the snowpack completely melts and when leaf-out occurs (Figure 4). This transition period appears to be lengthening, meaning that the rate of change for leaf-out is slower than the change for snowmelt, because leaf-out is not only affected by a warmer climate, but also by photoperiod which is not changing. After snowmelt occurs, soil temperatures rapidly increase, creating a “spring trigger” that stimulates microbial mineralization, mobilizing nutrients in soil solution. Because nutrient uptake by trees is generally low before leaf-out, the greatest losses of nutrients to streams occurs during this time. As this transition period gets longer, the amount of nutrients leached to streams could increase, potentially impairing water quality and soil fertility. These observations from the HBEF illustrate the marked changes that have occurred in the physical environment in the spring and fall seasons, which may exacerbate existing seasonal asynchronies between microbial activity and plant uptake.",

    "text": "2.6 Climate Change Manipulation Experiments\nWhile long-term data are valuable for identifying trends in climate and responses over time, field manipulation experiments are used to elucidate cause-and-effect relationships and improve mechanistic understanding. Ideally replicated experiments can be combined with long-term monitoring data to mechanistic models and provide a robust evaluation of climate change effects on ecosystem processes. There have been many different climate change manipulation experiments at the HBEF ranging from small laboratory experiments to larger plot-scale field studies. Here we highlight four of the more comprehensive studies that have occurred at the site (Figure 5). Soil Freezing Experiments\nSoil freezing is an important below-ground perturbation, having implications for the hydrology, biology and chemistry of ecosystems. At the HBEF, soil freezing impacts have primarily been investigated using snow removal experiments beginning in the mid-1990’s (Groffman et al. 1999, 2001; Figure 5a), but also more recently with natural gradients in soil freezing that occur across a range in elevation (Duran et al. 2016; Fuss et al. 2016). Snow removal experiments involve shoveling off the insulating layer of snow, thereby exposing the soil to cold winter air temperature to induce soil freezing. This research has shown that relatively mild freezing events (soil temperatures never decreasing below -4 °C) produced significant increases in soil inorganic nitrogen levels, solute leaching, root mortality and nitrous oxide flux. These responses to mild freezing were surprising in view of laboratory studies that suggested significant biogeochemical effects would only occur with a freezing event sufficiently severe (&gt; -10 °C) to directly cause root and microbial mortality. Apparently damage to roots by mild freezing is sufficient to reduce nitrogen uptake, thereby causing increased losses of nitrate from soils (Campbell et al., 2014). Climate Change Across Seasons Experiment\nWhereas many studies have evaluated the impacts of climate change on forests within a single season, few have examined the impacts of climate change across seasons and how these impacts interact. A study called Climate Change Across Seasons (CCASE) was initiated in 2012 to determine the interactive effects of winter and growing season climate on water and nutrient uptake and carbon sequestration in northern hardwood forests (Templer et al. In Review; Figure 5b). This study involves snow removal during winter to induce soil freezing, combined with warming during summer. Summer warming was accomplished by burying heating cables and maintaining the soil at 5 °C above ambient. The investigators hypothesize that warmer soil temperatures during the growing season will increase forest productivity, as well as rates of water, carbon, and nutrient uptake by trees and saplings. However, they expect that a reduced winter snowpack and increased soil freezing will offset these changes by damaging roots. Results from this study will improve understanding of the effects of climate change on rates of carbon sequestration and nutrient retention in these forests, as well as potential effects on air and water quality.",

    "text": "2.7 Drought-Net Experiment\nWhile mean annual precipitation in the Northeast is projected to increase modestly in the coming decades (especially in winter), it is expected to fall in fewer, more intense storms, with longer intervening dry periods. When combined with other changes in climate (i.e., less consistent snowpack, earlier snowmelt, and longer and hotter growing season), the altered precipitation regime may lead to a dramatic increase in growing season water stress in a region where species are not well adapted to drought. A throughfall removal experiment was initiated in 2014 to better understand the impacts of drought in mesic northern hardwood forests (Asbjornsen et al. In prep; Figure 5c). A series of troughs covering 50% of the ground surface was installed above plots to simulate a 1st percentile drought based on the long-term meteorological record. Drought and control plots are compared to determine the effect of reduced soil moisture availability on tree growth among other things. Ice Storm Experiment\nIce storms are rare and typically localized extreme weather events that are difficult to predict and have impacts that are poorly understood. An ice storm field manipulation experiment at the HBEF is being used to improve mechanistic understanding of short term ecological responses (Rustad et al. In prep; Figure 5d). During the winter of 2016, stream water was sprayed above the forest canopy when air temperatures were below freezing,effectively simulating a natural ice storm. The experimental design consists of plots with three levels of ice thickness treatment (0.25”, 0.50” and 0.75″ of ice accretion), as well as a control. The plots with the two more severe icing treatments experienced significant tree damage, creating canopy gaps. These plots also had large inputs of fine and coarse woody debris to the forest floor. The exposure to light and presence of brush piles in the more heavily damaged plots resulted in warming with increased spatial variability of soil temperature.\nIt was expected that the warmer temperatures in heavily damaged plots would result in an increase in soil respiration; however preliminary results indicate that soil respiration was actually lower in these plots possibly because of reduced root growth as noted following the natural ice storm event of 1999. It was also expected that nutrients in soil solution would increase due to lack of uptake by damaged vegetation. However, preliminary results have shown no significant changes in soil solution losses of nutrients despite significant forest canopy damage. Further monitoring will determine whether these trends continue in the future.\nFigure 5.

    "text": "3.1 Background\nChapter Editors: Mark Green and John Campbell\nFigure 1. Photo of V-notch weir at HB for measuring stream discharge.\nThe HBEF was established in 1955 for the purpose of studying the effects of forest management on streamflow and water quality, building upon pioneering work from other sites that established the efficacy of the paired small watershed approach (Bates and Henry 1928). The principle underlying the small watershed approach is that for a catchment with relatively watertight bedrock (thus minimal subsurface loss), water can leave the watershed only by stream discharge or evapotranspiration (ET). Hence, indirect measurement of annual ET (which is difficult to quantify directly) is obtained as the difference between annual precipitation and stream discharge measured using v-notch weirs (Figure 1).\nThe units in the hydrologic balance of a catchment are depth units (mm H2O) analogous to the familiar units of rainfall events. The volume discharge of the stream at the base of the catchment is divided by the projected area of the catchment to obtain depth units. The watershed balance of the catchment and annual ET are calculated on a water-year basis at the HBEF, from June 1 to May 31. A water year is determined by the point in time when there is the least amount of change in the volume of water stored in the watershed (especially soils and groundwater). This is accomplished by comparing precipitation and streamflow for successive 12 month periods over many years and determining what period has the highest correlation. This analysis indicates when water storage is most stable, which at the HBEF occurs after spring snowmelt when trees are leafing out and water storage is at a minimum.\nFigure 2. Long-term water balance in four watershed at Hubbard Brook: A. WS3, B. WS6, C. WS7, D. WS8. Originally published in Campbell et al. 2011; this figure is updated with current data available in the Environmental Data Initiative Repository (EDI; https://portal.edirepository.org). Hover over graph to access interactive controls available at the top right (zoom/pan/etc).\nHydrologists at the HBEF developed a long-term record of the water balance and annual ET for hydrologic reference watershed 3 (Figure 2). On average, about 40% of annual precipitation goes to ET and 60% to stream discharge. This partitioning to ET and streamflow varies considerably from year to year with a lower proportion to ET in wet years (in W3 minimum = 22% in WY 2010 and maximum = 53% in WY 1964). However, the absolute annual ET flux is relatively constant across years in the typically wet summer climate of HBEF where stomatal limitation of transpiration is less important than in drier climates. In an early experiment, WS2 was deforested, essentially eliminating transpiration (Likens et al. 1970). Of course, stream discharge dramatically increased as only about 9% of precipitation input was evaporated (Figure 3); because soil temperature and surface moisture were greatly elevated by the elimination of vegetation cover, soil and snowpack evaporation in this experiment (about 120 mm H2O/yr) was much higher than for closed canopy forest (see below).\nThe long-term record at the HBEF also demonstrates the response of the forest water balance to atmospheric and climate change. Three key environmental drivers have increased gradually at the HBEF since the 1950s: air temperature, annual precipitation and atmospheric CO2 concentration. In theory, increasing air temperature would be expected to cause higher evaporation (and ET) rates and, a longer leaf-on season of the deciduous trees, that should also contribute to higher ET. Indeed, phenological records from the HBEF indicate a lengthening leaf-on period (Keenan et al. 2014; Figure 4).\nConversely, higher atmospheric CO2 would be expected to increase stomatal control of transpiration (Eamus 1991). Our long-term, indirect estimate of annual ET for four reference watersheds at HB (WS3, WS6, WS7 and WS8) indicate little temporal change although the pattern differed slightly between the north- (WS7 and 8) and south-facing (WS6 and 3) watersheds (Figure 2). Trends in ET from other small watersheds in the Northeast are also inconsistent, suggesting that local site factors override broader regional drivers of ET. The exact cause of these trends is a topic of ongoing study at the HBEF.\nMost recently, water budgets in the four reference catchments indicated an approximately 30% increase in ET starting in 2010 and continuing through 2020 (Figure 2). We analyzed the annual water budgets, cumulative deviations of the daily P, RO and water budget residual (WBR = P − RO), potential ET (PET) and indicators of subsurface storage to gain greater insight into this shift in the water budgets (Green et al. 2021). The PET and the subsurface storage indicators suggest that this change in WBR was primarily due to increasing ET. While multiple long-term hydrological and micrometeorological data sets were used to detect and investigate this increase in ET, additional measurements of groundwater storage and soil moisture would enable better estimation of ET within the catchment water balance. Increasing the breadth of long-term measurements across small gauged catchments allows them to serve as more effective sentinels of substantial hydrologic changes like the ET increase that we observed.\nFigure 3.

    "text": "3.2 Hydrologic Processes: Precipitation and Snowmelt\nEarly reports from the HBES indicated annual precipitation at 130 cm/yr with about 25-30% occurring as snow. Annual precipitation at the HBEF has increased by about 20% over nearly 60 yr of record, reflecting the general trend for the Northeast region (Hayhoe et al. 2008). Most of this change has been in the warm season, as winter precipitation has not changed significantly; however, because of warmer winter temperatures, snowpack depth and the number of days with snow cover have declined. As a result snowmelt-induced high spring flows have declined. Low snow years are also associated with soil freezing events because the snowpack ordinarily insulates soil from cold winter air temperatures (Campbell et al. 2010).\nAn array of gages around the HBEF illustrates meso-scale variation in precipitation. In general, annual precipitation increases slightly with elevation (40 mm/100 m) as does the proportion in the form of snow. Due to local orographic effects, a significant west-to-east gradient of decreasing annual precipitation also is observed independent of elevation. Together, elevation and longitude explain 75% of the variation in long-term average annual precipitation.",

    "text": "3.3 Hydrologic Processes: Canopy Interception and Evaporation\nA considerable proportion of the precipitation falling on a forest is intercepted by the canopy, clings to the leaves and branches and never reaches the ground, eventually evaporating back to the atmosphere (I/E). Leonard (1961) conducted detailed studies of canopy I/E in the northern hardwood forest at HB. He estimated that 13% of gross precipitation (i.e., in the open) was lost as I/E during the leaf-on period. This value was only slightly lower (12%) during the leafless period, presumably because of high capture of snow in the canopy. Undoubtedly, canopy I/E is higher in the evergreen conifer zones. Moreover, studies in subalpine balsam fir forest near HB on Mt. Moosilauke indicated substantial augmentation of ambient precipitation by capture of cloud droplets (up to 46% of ambient rainfall; Lovett et al. 1982). Although direct measurements have not been made at HB, the magnitude of this input would be expected to be much lower as the HB environment has less wind and fog.\nEvaporation from soil (Es) has not been measured at HB.\nHowever, water isotope data at HB indicate that Es is minor relative to transpiration (Green et al. 2015). Estimates from other temperate deciduous forests suggest that Es is roughly 10% of total ET during the growing season (Moore et al. 1996).",

    "section": "3.4 Hydrologic Processes: Transpiration",
    "text": "3.4 Hydrologic Processes: Transpiration\nRoot water uptake and subsequent transpiration of water vapor from foliage is the principal pathway of water flux to the atmosphere. Transpiration flux depends upon environmental factors, especially air temperature, atmospheric humidity and soil moisture, as well as vegetation factors, particularly forest leaf area and leaf conductance (or resistance) to water vapor. Leaf area index (LAI) in the mature northern hardwood forest is relatively uniform spatially and temporally averaging about 6.5 (Battles et al. 2014). Recovery of leaf area following large-scale disturbance is surprisingly rapid as LAI of cutover sites reaches 90% of mature forest values within 6-10 yr. Thus, increases in water yield from cutover watersheds is transient; Hornbeck et al. (1997) observed that stream discharge on cut watersheds at HB increased for only a few years. Moreover, the role of species differences in stomatal conductance in determining forest transpiration was apparent; in particular, stream discharge from the young forest watershed on cutover WS4 was consistently about 5% higher than the reference watershed (Hornbeck et al. 1997). This was due to higher stomatal conductance (Federer 1977) of the pin cherry and birch that dominated the young forest, as compared with maple and beech in the reference forest.\nThe role of soil moisture stress in regulating transpiration at HB is less important than for more xeric forests (Federer and Gee 1974), and the strong trend of increasing warm season precipitation in the region further discounts this role. However, increasing air temperature could lead to higher transpiration rates as well as more midday stomatal closure owing to greater absolute humidity deficit (Montieth 1995). At the same time, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration would be expected to increase water-use efficiency (WUE) of plants and some evidence of increasing WUE and decreasing ET in northeastern forests has been observed (Keenan et al. 2013). Exactly how the coincident trends of increasing CO2, temperature and precipitation will affect forest transpiration in coming decades remains uncertain.\nAn unexpected result was observed regarding transpiration from the watershed-scale experimental restoration of soil Ca in WS1: stream discharge from the treated catchment decreased by about 20% for three years following the application of CaSiO3, indicating that transpiration had increased (Green et al. 2013). The causes of this striking response are unknown although follow-up studies indicate an increase in sapflow of mature forest trees, confirming the watershed mass-balance result. Another recent intriguing result, from a stable water isotope study on W3, indicates significant sub-canopy water recycling, as transpired water vapor apparently recondenses and is re-used by the understory vegetation (Green et al. 2015).\nMost recently, evidence of an unexpected increase in evapotranspiration has been suggested based on the long-term records of precipitation and runoff for the south-facing catchments at the HBEF. As explained earlier, we estimate annual AET using the annual water budget for the gauged watersheds at the HBEF, assuming minimal deep seepage or changes in soil/sediment storage. On this basis we observed a striking 30% increase in annual AET in the hydrologic reference watershed (W3) from 2010 to 2019 (Figure 1; Green et al. 2021). Although the drivers of this trend remain somewhat uncertain, analysis of water budget residuals, climatic data and evidence of possible soil storage changes indicate that subtle increases in PET and decreased canopy resistance may be driving the trend. Further study of forest physiology, soil moisture and groundwater dynamics is needed to better resolve this important issue in ecosystem hydrology.",

    "text": "3.5 Hydrologic Processes: Infiltration and Soil Water Redistribution\nSurface soils at HB are very porous because of high organic matter content and coarse textures. Hence, infiltration capacity is very high and infiltration-excess overland flow is uncommon (Pierce 1967). Overland flow has been observed on some occasions when infiltration is impeded. Surface soil scarification and compaction by heavy equipment during logging can result in overland flow on skid roads. In winters with cold temperatures and little insulating snow cover, saturated soils can freeze, forming concrete soil frost that limits infiltration and causes overland flow during winter and early spring. Localized saturation-excess overland flow occurs in particular landscape positions where perched water tables reach the surface during wet periods, explained below.\nRapid vertical percolation of soil water prevails under most situations in the HB watersheds. Indeed, the formation of the predominant Haplorthod soil profile is predicated on such a flow regime. (Gannon et al. 2014). However, the surface and subsurface topography and soil morphology in the HB watersheds is very complex. Bailey and co-workers (Bailey et al. 2014, Gannon et al. 2014) have demonstrated the utility of hydropedological units for characterizing this complexity at the small watershed scale: soil morphological characteristics and landscape position illustrate patterns of soil water redistribution. Observations on WS3 indicate a dynamic and spatially disconnected patchwork of water table development that depends on hillslope position, subsurface as well as surface topography and low porosity layers of dense glacial till and fragipans. These features can result in lateral subsurface flow as well as saturation-excess overland flow as detailed below. Watershed Hydrology: Stream Hydrograph, Stormflow and Contributing Area\nFigure 5. Hydrograph for watershed 6 showing stream discharge during a typical rain storm. (J. L. Campbell, unpublished data).\nThe flowpaths of water through soils to streams influence biogeochemical fluxes as well as temporal and spatial variation in stream discharge, all of which are key characteristics of stream habitats. An enduring challenge in watershed hydrology is understanding the processes supplying “baseflow” (i.e. streamflow following an extended interval without rain) and those generating “stormflow” and flood events.\nThe storm hydrograph is typically characterized by a steep rising limb following the beginning of a large rain (or snowmelt) event, a transient peak flow that can define flood effects and a prolonged receding limb following cessation of precipitation. The stream hydrograph in the HB experimental watersheds has been characterized as “flashy,” a term hydrologists use to denote a very rapid response to precipitation, a sharp peak and a quick return to baseflow (Figure 5). This behavior reflects the relatively short distances that water must travel in the watershed to reach the stream channel. Hooper and Shoemaker (1986) demonstrated that most stormflow discharge at HB was supplied by “old” water that resided as storage in the watershed for some time, but exactly where does this water come from?\nIn general, saturated areas in a catchment are capable of generating lateral flow to stream channels, and potentially supplying storm flow; such areas are denoted “active.” However, not all active areas actually contribute to the steeply-rising limb of a stormflow event. For example, if a patch of perched water table is separated by zones of low conductivity (drier soils) from other saturated zones, rapid flow from that patch will not occur. “Contributing” areas are saturated or near-saturated soils that are hydraulically connected to the stream and hence will contribute rapidly to stream discharge during rain events. The larger the contributing area in a watershed at a particular time, the greater and more rapid the streamflow response to a rain or melt event. Certainly riparian zones are most likely to be contributing areas both because of more frequent wet conditions and because of greater hydraulic connectivity to stream-channels. However, upland areas of a watershed can also be contributing areas. Gannon et al. (2014) observed differences in perched water table development among hydropedological units and different threshold responses in the storage-discharge relationships of these units, indicative of distinct subsurface flow regimes. Moreover, variably connected and disconnected active areas occur across WS3 at HB so that the contributing area for stormflow varies in complex ways with catchment storage.\nFigure 6. Evolution of the simulated median age of discharge during a 4 year period. Red and blue circles denote dry and wet periods; further analysis is included in Benettin et al. (2015).\nThe water flow dynamics of a watershed can be further abstracted to represent the age-distribution of stored water, or analogously the travel-time distribution of water reaching the stream channel. These features of catchment hydrology are important for understanding the biogeochemical behavior of the watershed-ecosystem because they integrate spatial heterogeneity and capture kinetic and equilibrium limitations on solute dynamics. Benettin et al. (2015) estimated the median travel time for water in WS3 to range from 50 to 200 days, depending upon catchment wetness (Figure 6). Notably, the analysis indicated a significant role of sub-soil glacial till below the tree rooting zone in supplying water (and solutes) to the stream in WS3.",
