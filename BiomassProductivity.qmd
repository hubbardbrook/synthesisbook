## Introduction


Biomass is the living (and sometimes including recently dead) organic
material synthesized by plants and other organisms. The accumulation of
biomass in forests is greater than in other Earth biomes because trees
must effectively lift their leaves above their neighbors in order to
compete for the light resource; hence, forest biomass provides the
structural material that allows the plants to grow tall. The biomass of
trees in forests forms the three-dimensional structure in which all the
other organisms are entrained and to which they are adapted for growth,
survival and reproduction. Much of the energy and carbon stored in the
forest resides in the biomass of the trees and understanding the factors
regulating forest biomass and its accumulation is of fundamental
importance to ecologists and foresters, alike.

Figure 1. Changes in living biomass during ecosystem development after
clear-cutting based on the average of two JABOWA simulations. (Bormann
and Likens, 1979).

In their classic treatise, Pattern and Process in a Forested Ecosystem,
Bormann and Likens (1979) developed a conceptual model for spatial and
temporal variation in the biomass of a northern hardwood forest, based
upon observations at Hubbard Brook and other regional forests. In the
temporal domain, they proposed four phases of ecosystem development
following large-scale disturbances (e.g., windstorm, clearcut harvest),
culminating in a steady-state phase in which total biomass fluctuates
around an equilibrium value (Figure 1). Measurements at Hubbard Brook
and elsewhere in the northern hardwood region have provided new insights
about this conceptual model and the magnitude and timing of forest
biomass accumulation.

Primary productivity is the process resulting from photosynthetic
activity of the plants and determines biomass accumulation in forests.
Net primary productivity (NPP) represents the difference between gross
photosynthesis of plant foliage and energy losses due to respiration and
mortality of plant tissues. Although NPP continues in the steady-state
phase of forest development, living biomass ceases to accumulate when
photosynthetic carbon gain is balanced by losses to plant respiration
and mortality. In general, the rate of biomass accumulation during the
transient phases of ecosystem development depends upon forest NPP;
hence, there has been great interest in understanding the factors
constraining NPP and how they may be affected by forest management and
environmental change.

In this chapter, we explain current understanding of forest biomass and
NPP in the context of the Hubbard Brook ecosystem, including: current
measurement techniques; patterns of temporal and spatial variation; the
environmental and biotic factors causing this variation; and the
implications for responses to global and regional environmental change.

## Forest Biomass

In many biomes, direct measurement of biomass can be accomplished simply
by weighing the tissue harvested from a measured area (e.g., clipping
herbaceous vegetation). This is impractical in forests and indirect
approaches have been developed. In general, these rely on the allometric
relationships between an easily-measured dimension of the plant and its
aboveground biomass. At Hubbard Brook, Whittaker et al. (1974) measured
the dimensions (e.g., diameter, height, biomass, etc.) of a sample of 93
trees of different species and sites, and developed allometric equations
relating the biomass of individual trees to their diameter and height.
Then, by measuring the diameter and height of trees on sampling plots of
known area, the forest biomass can be calculated by applying the
species-specific allometric equations. A compilation of allometric
equations of forest trees in USA has also been published (Jenkins et al.
2003). The statistical uncertainty of these aboveground biomass
estimates can also be determined by using Monte Carlo approaches (Yanai
et al. 2010)

Measuring the belowground (root) biomass of trees can be more
challenging. Both direct and indirect approaches have been applied at
Hubbard Brook. Whittaker et al. (1974) actually excavated the root
systems of the sampled trees described above, “with the encouragement of
dynamite.” This work provided a rare example in which allometric
equations include the tree root system, but recovery of the smallest
fine roots (\<0.5 mm diameter) is incomplete, and these roots are the
most functionally important. Alternatively, root biomass can be measured
directly by using a quantitative soil pit approach in which all the
roots are recovered from a soil pit of known ground area and volume.
Fahey et al. (1988) applied this method at Hubbard Brook and found close
agreement with estimates obtained using the allometric equations for the
coarse roots.

Most of the tree biomass in the mature forest (e.g., 100-yr-old forest
at Hubbard Brook) is contained in the woody tissues of the stem and
roots (91%), the remainder being leaves (1.7%), bark (5.1%), and fine
roots (2.2%). Understory vegetation comprises a very small biomass pool
(\<1 % of total plant biomass). The ratio of root:shoot biomass varies
with site quality and forest age, as discussed later, but averages about
0.25 in mature northern hardwood forest. The biomass of heterotrophic
organisms averages less than 0.6% that of plants, and is mostly (\~ 96%)
comprised of soil microbes (bacteria, fungi).

Forest biomass represents one of the largest and most sensitive carbon
pools on Earth and for that reason, ecologists and policy-makers have
become very interested in spatial and temporal patterns of forest
biomass. Forest biomass varies markedly among forest biomes, the highest
values attained in temperate and tropical rainforests, the lowest in
boreal woodlands, and intermediate values in temperate deciduous
forests. Within the Hubbard Brook valley a two-fold range of aboveground
biomass is observed in the ca. 100-yr-old-forest, with lowest values in
fir-birch-spruce forest on thin soils at higher elevations and highest
values in mixed hemlock-hardwoods in the lower valley (Figure 2).

Both tree species composition and site quality influence patterns of
maximum forest biomass that accumulates in the northern forest region.
For example, Kelty (1989) observed that mixed hemlock-hardwood stands
support significantly higher biomass than pure hardwood stands, perhaps
because of canopy architecture interactions; a similar pattern is seen
in the lower valley at HBEF (Figure 2). The site quality influence also
appears clearly at HBEF in the considerably higher biomass in enriched
soil, “cove” sites on W6 in comparison with adjacent stands on thin
soils of steeper slopes (Figure 2, inset).

The northern forest is recognized as a significant sink for C,
influencing the global C budget. This is in part because historical
forest harvest in the region reduced forest C storage and recovery to
the assumed steady-state is still in progress (Woodbury et al. 2007).
How long can we expect this ecosystem service to persist? The answer to
this question is complex, involving multiple environmental and biotic
factors as well as management and policy decisions. The conceptual model
of Bormann and Likens (1979) and its application in simulation models
originally suggested a transient, maximum forest biomass attained at
forest age 150-200 yr followed by slight decline to the steady-state,
old-growth phase (Figure 1). Empirical data from the Hubbard Brook
forest indicate that live tree biomass reached a plateau much lower than
predicted and at the age of only about 80 yr, owing to a variety of
factors including exotic insect pests and pathogens (e.g. beech bark
disease) and species declines unrelated to such pests (e.g., sugar
maple, yellow birch). By comparison, summaries for the region, based
upon various sources including USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and
Analysis (Lichstein et al. 2009) suggest an intermediate pattern, with
forest biomass in northern hardwoods reaching an asymptote at 125-150
years, at maximum values 30% lower than projected. Higher maximum
biomass values may be reached on richer sites such as alluvial valleys
(Keeton 2011). As explained below, site quality limitations partly
associated with soil nutrient depletion by acid deposition, contribute
to forest decline and the observed limitation of forest biomass
accumulation at Hubbard Brook and other regional forests (Battles et al.
2014). Moreover, impending invasion by additional exotic pests (hemlock
woolly adelgid, emerald ash borer) and effects of changing climate may
further constrain forest biomass accumulation. The implication is that
the combined effects of soil nutrient depletion, invasive pests and
pathogens and climate change could limit the future role of forest
biomass accumulation as a continuing sink for atmospheric CO2.

Biomass of the forest in the reference watershed, W6, has been estimated
periodically since 1965 by measuring the diameter of every tree in the
watershed and applying the allometric equations; these measurements
provide a detailed picture of changes in biomass for this previously
aggrading forest (Figure 2-2). As noted earlier, the Hubbard Brook
Forest accumulated biomass from the age of about 55 years in the early
1960s until the age of about 80 years in the 1980s. Since that time live
biomass on W6 has levelled off and even shown some significant decreases
owing to both natural disturbances (ice storm in 1998) and tree
declines. In particular, widespread decline of sugar maple has
contributed to the decrease in live biomass on W6. The cause of this
decline is undoubtedly associated with depletion of soil base cations by
acid deposition (see Acid Rain chapter). For example, the experimental
replacement on W1 of calcium, lost as a result of soil leaching in the
20th century, reinvigorated sugar maple and consequently biomass
accumulation resumed in the early 21st century (Figure 2-2). Continued
monitoring of these forests and perhaps another dose of calcium will be
needed to further inform these trends.

## Primary Productivity

Primary productivity (PP) is defined as the rate of energy or mass
storage in organic matter of plants per unit surface area of the earth.
In terrestrial ecosystems PP is conventionally divided into two
components: 1) gross primary productivity (GPP) is the amount of organic
material synthesized by plants per unit ground area per unit time, and
2) net primary productivity (NPP) is the amount of this organic material
that remains after respiratory consumption of organic matter by the
plants (Ra). All heterotrophic organisms rely on NPP for their food
requirements. In forests, Clark et al. (2001) emphasized that a working
definition of NPP for actual measurements must be adapted from the
formal definition (above) because direct measurements of GPP and Ra are
not possible and accounting for a variety of other losses of organic
material from plant tissues during a measurement interval also can be
challenging. In theory NPP could be quantified as:

Eq. 1. NPP = ∆B + M + H + L + V,

where ∆B is net change in biomass and M, H, L, and V are losses of
organic matter from plant tissues owing to mortality, herbivory,
leaching and volatilization, respectively. The reason that we must add
loss terms like mortality to ∆B when calculating forest NPP is
illustrated by the case where ∆B=0: if live biomass doesn’t change over
a time interval during which losses of organic material are occurring,
then the plants must have added new organic material to replace those
losses. Thus, the loss terms would be equal to this new production. To
estimate forest NPP at Hubbard Brook we quantify changes in live tree
biomass using the allometric equations (described above) and we estimate
the principal loss terms, tree mortality and mortality of ephemeral
tissues (leaves and fine roots). Some of the other loss terms in
Equation 1 also have been measured at Hubbard Brook. Although H, L and V
usually comprise a relatively small proportion of aboveground NPP
(ANPP), herbivory can be substantial during rare irruptions of
defoliating insects. For example, during the peak year of a 3-yr
irruption of a defoliating caterpillar (Heterocampa guttivita) about 44%
of leaf tissue was consumed in the hardwood forest at HBEF, with local
patches of 100% defoliation (Holmes and Sturges 1975). Finally, loss
terms for belowground NPP (BNPP) are notoriously difficult to measure
and can comprise a substantial portion of NPP that is particularly
sensitive to environmental changes, climate, atmospheric CO2 and soil
fertility. Table 1. Biomass and production components of northern
hardwood forest at Hubbard Brook (adapted from Fahey et al., 2005).
Biomass Components g/m2 (1997) Foliage 402 Branch 5436 Bark 1220 Wood

Aboveground perennial tissues 366 Total ANPP 708 (62) Fine roots 182
Coarse roots 76 Rhizosphere flux 160 Total BNPP 418 Total NPP 1126

The first estimates of ANPP of the Hubbard Brook forest were calculated
in the 1960s by Whittaker et al. (1974). At that time the forest on W6
was about 50 yrs old and ANPP was estimated at 924 g/m2-yr. Since that
time ANPP has declined considerably; Fahey et al. (2005) estimated ANPP
of the same forest at age ca. 90 yrs to be 708 g/m2-yr (Table 1).
Roughly half of this total was associated with increment of woody tissue
and half with replacement of ephemeral tissue (mostly foliage). The ANPP
of the northern hardwood forest at Hubbard Brook is similar to a variety
of other mature Acer-dominated forests worldwide (Table 2). Table 2.

Belowground production (BNPP) includes the growth of perennial woody
roots, the replacement of ephemeral fine roots as well as organic matter
allocated to mycorrhizal fungi and other rhizosphere fluxes (e.g. root
exudation). Direct observations of fine roots at Hubbard Brook using
minirhizotrons indicate that most of the smallest first-and second-order
roots have lifespans of about one year while higher order (order 3-4)
roots live for several years (Tierney and Fahey 2001). On the basis of
these observations fine root (\< 1mm) production has been estimated at
182 g/m2-yr, considerably lower than the production of aboveground
ephemeral tissues (342 g/m2 yr; Table 2). However, total rhizosphere C
flux has been estimated to be as high as 160 g/m2-yr (Fahey et al. 2005)
so that BNPP may comprise as much as 37% of total forest NPP (Table 1).

Spatial pattern of estimated aboveground net primary productivity across
the Hubbard Brook valley for 1990-1995.The interpolations are based on
370 plots for which diameter growth of all trees (\> 10 cm DBH) was
measured. Error estimates are given in the text. (Fahey et al., 2005)

Figure 3. Spatial pattern of estimated aboveground net primary
productivity across the Hubbard Brook valley for 1990-1995.The
interpolations are based on 370 plots for which diameter growth of all
trees (\> 10 cm DBH) was measured. Error estimates are given in the
text. (Fahey et al., 2005)

The spatial pattern of ANPP of the Hubbard Brook forest generally
reflects that of biomass (compare Figure 2 vs. 3).

For example, 42% of the variation in woody biomass production is
explained by aboveground biomass across the 370 plots represented in
Figure 2 and 3. The most notable decoupling between biomass and
productivity is for fir-birch-spruce dominated stands at the upper
elevations, where the production:biomass ratio is notably higher than
elsewhere in the HB valley. The temporal pattern of NPP following
large-scale disturbance follows the usual pattern of increase to a peak
value after a few decades, followed by decline at greater ages. Such an
age-related decline in NPP appears to be virtually universal in all
forests (Ryan et al. 1997) and has been attributed to a wide range of
causes. These temporal and spatial patterns beg the basic question: what
limits NPP in the Hubbard Brook forest?

productivity using the model PnET-II (Aber et al. 1995) parameterized
for a northern hardwood forest at the HBEF. Leaf area duration (LAIMo)
represents the product of daily estimated forest LAI and monthly time
intervals for each year. (Fahey et al., 2005).

productivity using the model PnET-II (Aber et al. 1995) parameterized
for a northern hardwood forest at the HBEF. Leaf area duration (LAIMo)
represents the product of daily estimated forest LAI and monthly time
intervals for each year. (Fahey et al., 2005).

In general, forest NPP is limited by a variety of environmental
conditions (e.g., temperature) and resources. In the cold temperate
climate of the Northeast the short growing season during which
temperatures are suitable for plant growth (i.e., the frost-free season
averages 145 d; Bailey et al. 2003) is a fundamental constraint on NPP.
Temperature limitations contribute to both temporal and spatial
variation in NPP at Hubbard Brook. For example, the time interval
between leaf out and senescence for the broadleaf deciduous trees varies
by about 30 d across years at HBEF (ca. 125-155 d; Bailey et al. 2003),
and the range of this index of growing season length across elevation
(480-820 m) at Hubbard Brook is about 21 days. According to the
simulation model PnET about 25% of annual variation in GPP can be
explained by growing season length; however, plant respiration also is
greater in years with long, warm seasons, so that the effect on NPP is
much lower (e.g., only 6% of annual in net photosynthesis is explained
by growing season length; Figure 4).

Another atmospheric condition that limits forest NPP is atmospheric CO2
concentration as demonstrated in free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) studies
in several forests (Norby et al. 2005). Although FACE experiments have
not been conducted at HBEF, we have used the PnET model to evaluate
possible effects of rising CO2 on NPP, independent of climate change
effects. One key effect of rising atmospheric CO2 concentration on
forest physiology is to allow greater stomatal control over water loss.
Water-use efficiency (WUE) is defined as the ratio of plant
photosynthesis per unit water loss by transpiration. Recent measurements
indicate that the WUE of northeastern U.S. forests has risen steadily
with atmospheric CO2 over the past two decades (Keenan et al. 2013),
probably explaining the unexpected observation that declining actual
evapotranspiration from the HB watersheds has accompanied rising
temperatures (see Climate Change chapter)

The water-use efficiency result emphasizes that soil resource
availability serves as an important constraint on forest NPP. Although
precipitation is moderately high at HBEF and evenly distributed through
the year, soil moisture deficits and drought stress occur occasionally.
The dominant tree species are drought avoiders that close their stomata
at relatively high soil water potential, thereby reducing potential
damage but restricting photosynthetic C gain (Federer 1977). Notably,
regional climate warming, which in the absence of CO2-induced increases
in WUE would promote higher water loss by the trees, has been
accompanied by increasing annual precipitation (see Climate Change
chapter)

The role of soil fertility in limiting NPP of northern hardwood forests
has received considerable study over the years. Based on a recent
meta-analysis of forest fertilization studies, Vadeboncoeur (2010)
concluded that NPP of most young northern hardwood forests (e.g. \< 30
yr) responded to the addition of N, P, K or Ca or various combinations,
with primary limitation by N being most common. Evidence for nutrient
limitation of NPP in mature forests was mixed. Recent results from an
ongoing N x P nutrient amendment experiment in and around HBEF suggest
that P limitation may be widespread in mature northern hardwood forests.

(Reiners et al., 2012).

The effects of natural variation in soil nutrient availability on
biomass accumulation and NPP of the Hubbard Brook forest have been
modified by inputs of pollutants derived from human activity: acid
precipitation and nitrogen deposition. Although direct evidence that N
deposition has altered NPP of the mature forest is scant, reduction of
NPP owing to depletion of soil base cations by acid deposition has been
shown conclusively in the Ca remediation experiment on W1 at
HBEF(Battles et al. 2013). As noted earlier, the unexpected plateau in
forest biomass on W6 is explained in part by this effect. Specifically,
soil Ca depletion has limited biomass accumulation primarily by causing
decline of the dominant species, sugar maple, which is particularly
sensitive to low soil Ca availability (Long et al. 2009). Crown
deterioration and reduced LAI of sugar maple, attributed to soil Ca
depletion, has contributed to the relatively low ANPP and biomass
accumulation on W6 (Battles et al. 2014). In addition to reduced net
photosynthesis owing to LAI loss, higher costs of wound repair and plant
defense accompany the impaired Ca nutrition of sugar maple in the
reference forest (Huggett et al. 2007; Halman et al. 2015). As detailed
by Tominaga et al. (2010), recovery of soil base cation status is
expected to be delayed in the immediate future because of the high
magnitude of 20th century losses and continuing acid deposition (albeit
at lower levels).

An interesting case study of the development of forest biomass and NPP
following large-scale disturbance in northern hardwoods is provided by
the deforestation study on W2. Reiners et al. (2012) hypothesized that
the extreme disturbance of the deforestation treatment on W2 (see W2
Experimental Summary) would exceed the capacity for forest ecosystem
resilience. In particular, the treatment resulted in loss of 28% of the
ecosystem stock of total N (as well as smaller proportions of base
cations); eliminated vegetative sprouting and advance regeneration as
sources of forest regeneration; and greatly reduced the abundance of
fast-growing pin cherry. Surprisingly, despite an initial lag in biomass
accumulation and net primary productivity, the forest on W2 followed a
trajectory similar to (though on the low end) of comparable sites that
had been harvested by conventional methods (Figure 5).

The slowest growth and biomass accumulation were observed in the upper
elevation zone of the watershed where soils are thinner and less fertile
(Johnson et al. 2000). These observations illustrate that northern
hardwoods forests on moderately fertile soils exhibit strong resilience
of productivity. The mechanisms contributing to this high resilience
deserve further study but may include biologically-enhanced weathering
of primary minerals (Blum et al. 2002), biological nitrogen fixation
(Bormann et al. 1993) and enhanced mineralization of relatively stable
soil organic matter.

## Forest Leaf Area Index

Forest productivity is powered by the capture of solar radiant energy by
plant foliage. The standard measurement of foliage abundance that
carries out this function is leaf area index (LAI), defined as the

(one-sided) area of foliage in the entire plant canopy per unit ground
area; essentially LAI is the number of layers of canopy foliage. In
mesic forests like Hubbard Brook with a closed canopy, where LAI is
little constrained by soil water availability, the maximum LAI is
limited by self-shading because foliage at the bottom of the canopy
receives insufficient insolation to effectively carry out the
photosynthetic function. Forest LAI can be measured in a variety of
ways, including LIDAR that can remotely sense objects in the canopy;
however, this relatively recent tool measures plant area index,
including stem/branch surfaces and requires correction factors. In the
deciduous northern hardwood forest that dominates the Hubbard Brook
landscape, LAI can also be measured conveniently by quantifying leaf
litterfall. Litterfall records for the Hubbard Brook Forest go back over
thirty years (Figure 6) and also allow estimation of LAI of each of the
various tree species.

The total LAI of the northern hardwood forest adjacent to reference W6
averages a little less than 6. In the absence of disturbances LAI is
pretty constant from year to year, but considerable spatial variation
across the study area is observed (Figure #): the highest values of 7 to
8 are observed in coves with enriched soils and sugar maple dominance
while the lowest values (3.5 to 4) coincide with thin depleted soils in
the upper watershed. Comparison between the reference forest adjacent to
W6 and the Ca-treated W1 (Figure #) illustrates the role of soil base
status and sugar maple health in regulating forest LAI and NPP in the
experimental watersheds at Hubbard Brook. These patterns reflect site
quality variation that clearly constrains the NPP of the wider forest
landscape.

The temporal pattern in LAI also reflects the effect of disturbances. In
particular, a clear decrease in forest LAI accompanied disturbance by
the 1998 ice storm: LAI was reduced in half for two years before
gradually recovering to pre-disturbance levels by about 2003-4 (Figure
6). Since that time LAI has been relatively constant on a large-scale
average, although localized decreases have been observed resulting from
smaller disturbances (late-spring frost, microburst windstorm).
Continued monitoring is needed to allow researchers to capture effects
of environmental change on forest health and dynamics (Fahey et al.
2022).

## Questions for Further Study.

* What are the mechanisms contributing to soil nutrient limitation of forest productivity?
* Why does forest NPP decline with stand age – so-called “age-related NPP decline”?
* How does BNPP associated with rhizosphere carbon flux vary across the forest landscape, and what environmental and biotic factors influence this flux pathway?
* How will forest NPP respond to the long-term amelioration of soil calcium depletion on WS1?
* Conversely, will the depletion of soil calcium resulting from whole-tree harvest limit forest NPP on WS5?
* How will forest NPP and biomass accumulation respond to continued changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide concerntration?
